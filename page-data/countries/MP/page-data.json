Saipan, the largest island, is known for its sandy shores and mountainous landscapes. In clear waters off its west coast is the tiny, coral-fringed Ma√±agaha islet. On Saipan's northeast coast, turtles inhabit the Grotto, a cavern dive site. Nearby, memorials mark Banzai Cliff and Suicide Cliff, sites from WWII's Battle of Saipan.","created_by":1,"updated_by":1,"status":"published","translations":[],"joshua_project":{"country_id":"MP","language_official_iso":"eng","language_official_name":"English","population":53654,"population_unreached":889,"people_groups":11,"people_groups_unreached":1,"joshua_project_scale":5,"primary_religion":"Christianity","percent_christian":74.91,"resistant_belt":0,"percent_literate":97,"created_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:20","updated_at":"2018-02-12 19:36:20"},"geography":{"country_id":"MP","location_description":"Oceania, islands in the North Pacific Ocean, about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to the Philippines","latitude":"17.3308300","longitude":"145.3846900","mapReferences":"Oceania","area_sqkm_total":464,"area_sqkm_land":464,"area_sqkm_water":0,"area_km_coastline":1,"area_note":"2.5 times the size of Washington, DC","climate":"tropical marine;
