The languages belong to the Popolocan subgroup of the Oto-Manguean language family. Under the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples they are recognized as \\\"national languages\\\" along with the other indigenous languages of Mexico and Spanish. The Mazatec language is vigorous in many of the smaller communities of the Mazatec area, and in many towns it is spoken by almost all inhabitants; however, the language is beginning to lose terrain to Spanish in some of the larger communities like Huautla de Jimenez and Jalapa de Díaz. Like other Oto-Manguean languages, the Mazatecan languages are tonal, and tone plays an integral part in distinguishing both lexical items and grammatical categories. The centrality of tone to the Mazatec language is exploited by the system of whistle speech which is employed in most Mazatec communities and which allows speakers of the language to have entire conversations only by whistling.\r\n © 1960, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc."},{"language_id":2418,"bible_id":"MAUWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Xon⁴-le⁴ ni³na¹ xi³ tʔa³tsʔe⁴ Jesucristo","description":null}]},{"id":"MBZWBT","language_id":224,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2010","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"MBZWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"New Testament Portions in Mixtec, Amoltepec","description":"Talking Bibles Entity"}]},{"id":"MCOTBL","language_id":1356,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1976","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"MCOTBL","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Mixe De Coatlan 1976 Edition","description":"Coatlán Mixe, also known as Southwestern Mix, is a language of Mexico.
