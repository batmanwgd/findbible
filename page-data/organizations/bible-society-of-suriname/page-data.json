It began as a pidgin spoken primarily by African slaves in Suriname who often did not have a common African language. As other ethnic groups were brought to Suriname as contract workers, Sranan became a lingua franca.\r\nAlthough the formal Dutch-based educational system repressed its use, Sranan became more accepted by the establishment over time, especially during the 1980s when it was popularized by Suriname's then dictator Dési Bouterse who often delivered national speeches in Sranan.\r\nSranan remains widely used in Suriname and in large Dutch urban areas populated by immigrants from Suriname, especially in casual conversation where it is often mixed in freely with Dutch.\r\nSranan as a written language has existed since the late 19th century, and was given an official spelling by the government of Suriname on July 15, 1986 (resolution 4501).\r\n"},{"language_id":6407,"bible_id":"SRNBSS","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Nyun Testamenti","description":null}]},{"id":"WAPWBT","language_id":7335,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2012","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"WAPWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Wapishana 2012 Edition","description":null},{"language_id":7335,"bible_id":"WAPWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Kaimanaꞌo Tominkaru Paradan - Wapichan Paradan Idaꞌanaꞌo","description":null}]}],"translations":[{"id":133,"language_id":4754,"vernacular":0,"name":"बाइबल सोसाइटी अफ सुरिनाम","description_short":null},{"id":453,"language_id":6411,"vernacular":0,"name":"Sociedad Bíblica de Surinam","description_short":null},{"id":794,"language_id":6414,"vernacular":0,"name":"Suriname Bible Society","description_short":"Serving Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana by distributing the Word of God."}],"logos":[],"relationships":[],"resources":[]},"bibles":[{"id":"AKEBSS","date":"2010","name":"Akawaio 2010 Edition","vname":"Wakʉ Itekare: Emenna' Pe Ekonekan Nɨto'"},{"id":"CARBSS","date":"2003","name":"Galibi Carib 2003 Edition","vname":"Asery Tamusi karetary Het Nieuwe Testament in het Karaïbs"},{"id":"PBCBSS","date":"2011","name":"Patamona 2011 Edition","vname":"EMENNAK WAKÙ ITEKALE"},{"id":"SRNBSS","date":"2002","name":"Sranan Tongo 2002 Edition","vname":"Nyun Testamenti"},{"id":"WAPWBT","date":"2012","name":"Wapishana 2012 Edition","vname":"Kaimanaꞌo Tominkaru Paradan - Wapichan Paradan Idaꞌanaꞌo"}],"resources":[]}}}
