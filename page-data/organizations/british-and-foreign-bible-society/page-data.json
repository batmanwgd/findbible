The final editing of this edition was done by E. P. Groenewald, A. H. van Zyl, P. A. Verhoef, J. L. Helberg, and W. Kempen. This translation was a dynamic equivalence translation, and was the first Afrikaans translation not to make use of the majority text. The New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs were published in 1975, to mark the 100th anniversary of the Afrikaans language."}]},{"id":"AHAANT","language_id":90,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2009","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"AHAANT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The New Testament in Ahanta","description":null},{"language_id":90,"bible_id":"AHAANT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Fuld Ni","description":null}]},{"id":"AHBBFBS","language_id":455,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1935","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"AHBBFBS","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The Gospel of John in Axamb","description":null},{"language_id":455,"bible_id":"AHBBFBS","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Naujin ga voi ili Jon ga tutusi.","description":null}]},{"id":"AINB97","language_id":105,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1897","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"AINB97","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Batchelor 1897","description":null},{"language_id":105,"bible_id":"AINB97","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Chikoro utarapa ne Yesu Kiristo","description":null}]},{"id":"AKATWI","language_id":124,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2008","scope":"FB","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"AKATWI","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Twi Akuapem Bible","description":null},{"language_id":124,"bible_id":"AKATWI","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Godɨn Akar Aghuim; Akar Dɨkɨrɨzir Gavgavir Igiam","description":null}]},{"id":"ALNGSA","language_id":2090,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1866","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"ALNGSA","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The Four Gospels and Acts in Gheg Albanian","description":"Ke̥ʘṳem Prei Greḱïštese̥ Viete̥r Šḱip Nde̥ Ǵuhe̥ Gege̥nište prei Konstantinit Kristoforidit, Elbasanasit."},{"language_id":2090,"bible_id":"ALNGSA","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Kater unǵilatʼ e zotit ede še̥ĺbŭesit tʼṳne̥ Iesu Kris̆tit, ede Pune̥tʼ e Apǒstuyvet","description":"Ke̥ʘṳem Prei Greḱïštese̥ Viete̥r Šḱip Nde̥ Ǵuhe̥ Gege̥nište prei Konstantinit Kristoforidit, Elbasanasit."}]},{"id":"ALQKNP","language_id":169,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1844","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"ALQKNP","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Matthew and Acts in Putawatomie","description":null},{"language_id":169,"bible_id":"ALQKNP","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Kao Nuperuk e Putrwatmemwun","description":null}]},{"id":"ALSB55","language_id":6914,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1555","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"ALSB55","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"The Buzuku Translations","description":"Albanian priest Gjon Buzuku translated selected Scripture portions into Albanian which were printed in the first known Albanian book, The Missal (Meshari), composed in the Gheg dialect of Albanian.

The New Testament was completed in 2005, and was published in its own book editions and in conjunction with the 1978 translation of the Old Testament. Several prominent Norwegian writers, such as Karl Ove Knausgård, Håvard Rem, Jon Fosse and Hanne Ørstavik, have been literary consultants for the new Bible translation, and helped with the translation work.\r\n\r\nBible 2011 has become the preferred Bible translation in the Norwegian Church. The shared Bible, with the Old Testament of the 1978 translation and the New Testament from the new translation, was presented in some churches in connection with sermon and reading texts from 2005. \\\"Textbook for the Norwegian Church\\\" was published in 2011 and was taken into use for the first time on the 1st Sunday in Advent (First Sunday in the Church Year); It uses the Bible Society 2011 translation.\r\n\r\nThe translation was met with good reviews immediately after the deadline had expired on the release date.\r\n"},{"language_id":5024,"bible_id":"NOBB11","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Bibelen 2011 bokmål","description":null}]},{"id":"NPINRV","language_id":4756,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"devanagari","date":"2001","scope":"NT","script":"Deva","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"NPINRV","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Nepali New Revised Version","description":null}]},{"id":"NXQMRK","language_id":4696,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1932","scope":"P","script":"Qabo","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"NXQMRK","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The Gospel of Mark in Naxi","description":null}]},{"id":"NYMMHO","language_id":5118,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1901","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"NYMMHO","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Nyamwezi New Testament","description":null},{"language_id":5118,"bible_id":"NYMMHO","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Mhola ja Tjelu ja Ilagano Lipya","description":null}]},{"id":"OJIJHN","language_id":5188,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1831","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"OJIJHN","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Gospel of John in Ojibwa","description":null}]},{"id":"PBUGNP","language_id":4930,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"eastern-arabic","date":"1890","scope":"P","script":"Arab","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"PBUGNP","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Genesis Portion in Northern Pashto","description":null}]},{"id":"PESKID","language_id":7410,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"persian","date":"2010","scope":"P","script":"Arab","derived":"Today's Persian Version","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"PESKID","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Children's Bible","description":null}]},{"id":"PESOPV","language_id":7410,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"persian","date":"1895","scope":"FB","script":"Arab","derived":"","copyright":"Public Domain","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"PESOPV","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Old Persian Version","description":"The Old Persian Version: The “Old Persian Translation” is the result of the several decades of hard work on the part of various translators over the early 19th century.
