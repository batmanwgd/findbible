It is also known as Sapalewa or Patasiwa Alfoeren and, despite the small number of speakers, it has a few dialects. The most prestigious dialect is the Rambatu way of speaking. The Hainuwele legend is an origin myth from the Alune and Wemale folklore. It was recorded by German ethnologist Adolf Ellegard Jensen in a 1937–8 expedition to the Maluku Islands.\r\n\r\nLike other ancient human groups living in interior Seram, the Alune traditionally lived off forest products. Their diet is based on the sago palm and they also practiced shifting cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Alune were also skilled carpenters. The ancestral Alune houses were large and elaborate and built of wood, sticks and palm leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Alune culture and lifestyle has changed very much during the last few decades because of the impact of consumerism. Also the political and religious restlessness and the resulting conflict in Indonesia affected many islands of the Maluku area.\r\n"},{"language_id":182,"bible_id":"ALPWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Janji beluke","description":null}]},{"id":"ALQWBT","language_id":169,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1998","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"ALQWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Algonquin New Testament","description":"The translation represented by this text was started under the auspices of the North American Branch of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in 1975.

All rights reserved. Bakairí (Bacairí) is a Cariban language of Brazil. The Bakairi call themselves Kurâ, which means 'people' or 'human beings'. They consider themselves the true Kurâ, humanity par excellence, while other beings have to be specified. Kurâ expresses, stricto sensu, \\\"we, the Bakairi\\\", \\\"what is ours\\\". The origin of the term Bakairi is unknown to them and is found recorded in the chronicles of regional history since the 18th Century.\r\n\r\nThe Bakairi language belongs to the Karib family. According to scholars, it has some elements in common with the languages of the Arára and Txikão and other elements in common with Nahukwá and Kuikúru. All Bakairi speak their own language as well as Portuguese.\r\n\r\nSince the 1960s, missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (S.I.L.) have been translating Biblical texts to the Bakairi language. They have also elaborated readers to teach reading and writing in the maternal language. These works have tended to uniformize the internal differences, which are worth a careful study.\r\n\r\nThey live in the state of Mato Grosso, on the Bakairi Indigenous Lands (61,405.5905 hectares) and Santana (35,479.7443 hectares). In both, shrub forest predominates.\r\n\r\nSantana is located in the municipality of Nobres and gets its name from one of the tributaries of the Rio Novo which, in forming part of its limits, descends to the Arinos, tributary of the Juruena, branch of the Tapajós.\r\n\r\nThe Bakairi Indigenous Land is almost entirely located in the municipality of Paranatinga, on the right bank of the Paranatinga or Telles Pires River, tributary of the Tapajós. A part of it is situated in the municipality of Planalto da Serra, on the left bank of that river. In the vicinity there are the Urubu and Daniel hills, and part of Serra Azul.\r\n\r\nLegally, both indigenous lands have been strictly regularized: homologated and registered in the Estate Service of the Union and in the Notary Public for the Registry of Properties.\r\n\r\nThe urban centers that exercise most influences on the lives of the Bakairi are Nobres, Paranatinga and Cuiabá, the capitol of the state.\r\n\r\nThe Bakairi today total around 950 people, of which 898 live on Indigenous Lands.\r\n\r\nThe mythical origin place of the Bakairi – Sawâpa waterfall – is located below the confluence of the Verde River with the Paranatinga. Due to internal conflicts and pressures from enemy indigenous peoples, basically the Kayabí, the Bakairi migrated in three different directions. A part of them went to the headwaters of the Arinos; it was the first to be reached by the bandeira expeditions in the first decades of the 18th Century, after which they got involved in mining activities. Another went to the upper Paranatinga; they were surrounded by colonizers, cattle-raisers or agriculturalists or got involved in activities related to these, in the first decades of the 19th Century. The third group, which was the largest, went in the direction of the upper Xingu, losing contact with the other two. The first two groups of Bakairi came to be known as “tame” or “independent”. Later Karl von den Steinen would come to call them “western\\\", differentiating them from the “eastern” group of the upper\r\n\r\nAfter 1847, the Bakairi of Arinos, also said to be from Santana, along with those of the upper Paranatinga, visited with frequency the General Directorate of Indians in Cuiabá, hoping to receive presents. Later, they got involved in rubber-gathering, especially those of Santana, going to commercialize it in the capitol. The Bakairi of Santana ended up working compulsorily in rubber extraction, even on their own lands, for the rubber-bosses who occupied these lands. Prohibited from speaking their language, among other sorts of violence practiced against them, some of these Bakairi migrated to Paranatinga in the decades from 1920 to 1960. But they were forced to leave by employees of the SPI who claimed, as did the rubber-bosses, that they stole cattle. The creation of the Santana Indian Post in 1965, did not change this situation. From that time on, the S.I.L.(Summer Institute of Linguistics), established its presence there, intermittently, as did Jesuit missionaries. Years later, the Bakairi themselves forced the invaders out of Santana. Only in 1975 was a school built in this area.\r\n\r\nThe Bakairi of the Paranatinga were guides, canoe makers and interpreters in the expeditions of von den Steinen – undertaken in 1884 and 1887 – and in others that came after them. Through these expeditions, the relations between the Eastern and Western Bakairi, in the terminology of vem den Steinen, were re-established. Before then, the Bakairi and other peoples of the upper Xingu were unknown to the whites.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the Indian Post was created and the Bakairi Indigenous Land was demarcated, but leaving outside its limits the group of Antoninho, the famous guide of von den Steinen. The objective was to attract all upper Xingu Indians into the area, and thus conquer lands and manual labor for colonization. But only the Bakairi definitively moved to the Paranatinga and three years later their presence in the upper Xingu was no longer recorded. Critically reduced in number, those who had been transferred re-organized into several groups on the banks of the Paranatinga, and were submitted to compulsory labor by the agents of the SPI. The other Indians of the upper Xingu visited the Post in search of “presents\\\".\r\n\r\nIn this period of territorial losses and depopulation, missionaries of the South American Indian Mission began to work among them, and stayed until the 1960s when the Bakairi pressured them to leave. In 1922, a school was also built in the area. Twenty years later, the various local groups were brought together into one single “settlement”, by the side of the Post, since mobility and dispersion, both essential to their universe of sociability, were considered an impediment to education and health services. Those who did not submit to the imposed order were transferred to other indigenous areas, above all those of their enemies. Several Bakairi participated, compulsorily, in the “pacification” of a Xavante group, on the upper Batovi. A part of these Xavante migrated to the Bakairi Indigenous Lands, but in 1974, with a population of 180 people, which surpassed the Bakairi population, they left for the Culuene River.\r\n\r\nThe decade of the 1980s was marked by Community Development Projects financed with resources of the World Bank, which introduced in the two areas trucks and mechanized agriculture, among other things. On the Bakairi Indigenous Land, in this period, the Bakairi recovered an area of lands that had been taken away from them at the time of the second demarcation. The unequal access to the goods introduced resulted in the fragmentation of the existing “settlement” and in the constitution of the present local groups. \r\n\r\nBefore 1884 the Bakairi received only rapid mention on the part of members of bandeira expeditions, explorers of the north of Mato Grosso and administrators of the then province. It was only after the expeditions of Karl von den Steinen to the Xingu, in 1884 and 1887, that the information about them gets more dense. Two books of his are worth noting: Central Brazil: Expedition of 1884 for the exploration of the Xingu (1942) and *Among the Aborigines of Central Brazil *(1940), both classics in South American ethnology. They contain precious information on the Eastern and Western Bakairi, their history, language, social organization, mythology, rituals and relations with other indigenous peoples. Various other expeditions followed those of von den Steinem, especially those by Max Schmidt, who recorded, among other things, important data on the migrations of the Bakairi of the Xingu to the Paranatinga and the relations they established with the regional population, including with the SPI agents. Kalervo Oberg and Fernando Altenfelder Silva, who were among the Bakairi in the mid-20th Century, published articles on social organization and ritual seclusion, respectively.\r\n\r\nThere are five academic monographs on the Bakairi. The first, by Edir Pina de Barros (1977), brings together information on their history and social organization, their relations with missionaries, SPI agents and rural land-holders of the region. In the light of this data, she analyzes the question of identity and ethnicity. In her doctoral thesis (1992), this same researcher presents dense information on their history, cosmology, social organization, naming practices, rituals and shamanism. Various of her articles have been published in anthropological journals. Another reference is the thesis by Debra Sue Picchi (1982), which focuses on the impact of mechanized agriculture on the traditional subsistence system, nutritional status and health. To analyze this question, historical, cultural, and above all, ecological factors were considered.\r\n\r\nDarlene Yaminalo Taukane, a Bakairi woman, wrote, in her recently published Master’s dissertation, about school education among the Bakairi of Paranatinga, including the reflection of indigenous teachers on school education and the place of the school in their project for the future, besides an important chapter on the process of socialization in their society, which has already been published in the form of an article. In relation to their language, there is the doctoral thesis by Tânia Conceição Clemente de Souza, on discourse and orality among the Bakairi of Paranatinga. There is also the classic study of language by Capistrano de Abreu made on the basis of information of an informant brought from Paranatinga to Rio de Janeiro, in the final decade of the 19th Century. There are also the studies done by missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, since the 1960s. Noteworthy among these are the translations of Biblical texts and readers for literacy in the maternal language. Under their auspices, the Bakairi have been producing texts in their own language, some of them published. The Bakairi teachers are producing texts, in the context of their training as teachers.

The Bribri are an indigenous people of Costa Rica. They live in the Talamanca (canton) in the Limón Province of Costa Rica. They speak the Bribri language and Spanish. There are varying estimates of the population of the tribe. According to a census by the Ministerio de Salud, there are 11,500 Bribri living within service range of the Hone Creek Clinic alone. They are a voting majority in the Puerto Viejo de Talamanca area. Other estimates of tribal population in Costa Rica range much higher, reaching 35,000.\r\nThe Bribri were the autochthonous people of the Talamanca region, living in the mountains and Caribbean coastal areas of Costa Rica and northern Panama. The majority live with running water and a scarce amount of electricity, growing cacao, bananas, and plantain to sell as well as beans, rice, corn, and a variety of produce for their own consumption. \r\nMany Bribri are isolated and have their own language. This has allowed them to maintain their indigenous culture, although it has also resulted in less access to education and health care. Although the group has the lowest income per capita in the country, they are able to raise much of their own produce, medicine, and housing materials, and earn cash to purchase what they can't grow themselves through tourism and by selling cacao, bananas, and plantain.\r\nThe Bribri people live in the mountains and islands southern Costa Rica and northern Panama both on reservations and non-protected areas.\r\nThe Bribri social structure is organized in clans. Each clan is composed of an extended family. The clan system is matrilineal, that is, a child's clan is determined by the clan his or her mother belongs to. This gives women a very important place in Bribri society since they are the only ones that can inherit land. Men's roles are defined by their clan and are often exclusive for men.\r\nCacao has a special significance in Bribri culture, as is the case for most of the indigenous groups in southern Costa Rica and northern Panama. Currently there exists several Bribri women's associations that produce organic, hand made chocolate that helps them in their livelihoods.\r\nThe Shaman, or \\\"awa\\\" holds a very important place in Bribri society. Awapa (plural for awa) train since they are about 8 years old, the training is said to last between 10 and 15 years. Only certain clans are allowed to become awapa. Since the clan comes from the mother's side of the family, an awa cannot teach his own sons, but rather the sons of his female relatives.\r\nAgriculture is the main activity of the Bribri. The Bribri are isolated, and have developed an extensive bartering system. One small group of Bribri, who live in the community called Kekoldi, only has about 200 people. They partake in the unique practice of iguana farming. These iguanas are released into the forest so any other Bribri can hunt them for their food and skin. The farm has been operating for 11 years and has about 2,000 iguanas and 2,000,000 eggs. The iguanas stay on the farm until five years of age at which time they are released into the wild. The Bribri have maintained their own culture."},{"language_id":960,"bible_id":"BZDWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Tte Pa̱'a̱li̱ Me' Skëköl tö Se' a̱","description":null}]},{"id":"BZFGEN","language_id":881,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":null,"scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":null,"copyright":null,"reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"BZFGEN","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Portions of the Bible in Boikin","description":null}]},{"id":"BZHPNG","language_id":4094,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2003","scope":"NTP","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"BZHPNG","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Buang (Mapos) New Testament 2003","description":null},{"language_id":4094,"bible_id":"BZHPNG","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Mehöböp Yesu Kerisi yi GAGEK MEWIS sën vong yam vu hil","description":null}]},{"id":"BZHSIL","language_id":4094,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":null,"scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":null,"copyright":null,"reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"BZHSIL","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Portions of the Bible in Mapos Buang","description":null}]},{"id":"BZHWBT","language_id":4094,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2013","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"BZHWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Central/Mapos Buang New Testament","description":null},{"language_id":4094,"bible_id":"BZHWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Mehöböp Yesu Kerisi yi GAGEK MEWIS sën vong yam vu hil","description":null}]},{"id":"BZIWBT","language_id":855,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"thai","date":"2014","scope":"NT","script":"Thai","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"BZIWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The New Testament in Bisu","description":null}]},{"id":"BZJBSW","language_id":735,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2012","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"BZJBSW","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Belize Kriol English 2012 Edition","description":"© 2012, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.. All rights reserved. Belize Kriol is derived mainly from English. Its substrate languages are the Native American language Miskito, and the various West African and Bantu languages which were brought into the country by slaves. These include Akan, Efik, Ewe, Fula, Ga, Hausa, Igbo, Kikongo and Wolof.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous theories as to how creole languages form. A language emerged from the contact of English landowners and their West African slaves to ensure basic communication. The Baymen first began to settle in the area of Belize City in the 1650s. In 1786 the British were supposed to cease all logwood cutting operations along the Caribbean coast of Central America, except for the Belize settlement. Many of the settlers from the Miskito Coast moved to Belize, bringing their Miskito Coast Creole with them. The immigrants outnumbered the Baymen five to one. The local Kriol speech shifted to become something more like the Miskito Coast Creole.\r\n\r\nToday, Belize Kriol is the first or second language of the majority of the country's inhabitants. Many of them speak standard English as well, and a rapid process of decreolization is going on. As such, a creole continuum exists and speakers are able to code-switch among various mesolect registers between the most basilect to the acrolect (\\\"Mid-Atlantic\\\") varieties.

There are 500 speakers of Souther Carrier (1987 SIL). 2,060 identified in 2001. This census does not separate Babine, Central Carrier, and Southern Carrier speakers. All Athapaskan L1 speakers in Canada total as 20,100 speakers (1998 census). \r\n\r\nCarrier is generally regarded as one of three members of the central British Columbia subgroup of Athabascan, the other two being Babine-Witsuwit'en and Chilcotin. As noted above, the term \\\"Carrier\\\" has often been applied to both Carrier proper and Babine-Witsuwit'en but this identification is now rejected by specialists. The Ethnologue treats Carrier proper as consisting of two languages, Carrier (code: crx) and Southern Carrier (code: caf), where the latter consists of the dialects of the Ulkatcho, Kluskus, Nazko, and Red Bluff bands. More recent research disputes the treatment of \\\"Southern Carrier\\\" as a distinct language and in fact classifies this dialect group as one of two parts of a larger \\\"Southern Carrier\\\" dialect group that contains all of Carrier proper except for the Stuart/Trembleur Lake dialect. Southern Carrier in the sense of the Ethnologue, that is, the Blackwater dialect group, is mutually comprehensible with all other Carrier dialects.\r\n\r\nCarrier is neighbored on the west by Babine-Witsuwit'en and Haisla, to the north by Sekani, to the southeast by Shuswap, to the south by Chilcotin, and to the southwest by Nuxalk. Furthermore, in the past few centuries, with the westward movement of the Plains Cree, there has been contact with the Cree from the East. Carrier has borrowed from some of these languages, but apparently not in large numbers. Loans from Cree include [məsdus] ('cow') from Cree (which originally meant \\\"buffalo\\\" but extended to \\\"cow\\\" already in Cree) and [sunija] ('money, precious metal'). There are also loans from languages that do not directly neighbor Carrier territory. A particularly interesting example is [maj] ('berry, fruit'), a loan from Gitksan, which has been borrowed into all Carrier dialects and has displaced the original Athabascan word.\r\n\r\nEuropean contact has brought loans from a number of sources. The majority of demonstrable loans into Carrier are from French, though it is not generally clear whether they come directly from French or via Chinook Jargon. Loans from French include [liɡok] ('chicken') (from French le coq 'rooster'), [lisel] (from le sel 'salt'), and [lizas] ('angel'). As these examples show, the French article is normally incorporated into the Carrier borrowing. A single loan from Spanish is known: [mandah] ('canvas, tarpaulin'), apparently acquired from Spanish-speaking packers.\r\n\r\nThe trade language Chinook Jargon came into use among Carrier people as a result of European contact. Most Carrier people never knew Chinook Jargon. It appears to have been known in most areas primarily by men who had spent time freighting on the Fraser River. Knowledge of Chinook Jargon may have been more common in the southwestern part of Carrier country due to its use at Bella Coola. The southwestern dialects have more loans from Chinook Jargon than other dialects. For example, while most dialects use the Cree loan described above for \\\"money\\\", the southwestern dialects use [tʃikəmin], which is from Chinook Jargon. The word [daji] ('chief') is a loan from Chinook Jargon.\r\n\r\nEuropean contact brought many new objects and ideas. The names for some were borrowed, but in most cases terms have been created using the morphological resources of the language, or by extending or shifting the meaning of existing terms. Thus, [tɬʼuɬ] now means not only \\\"rope\\\" but also \\\"wire\\\", while [kʼa] has shifted from its original meaning of \\\"arrow\\\" to mean \\\"cartridge\\\" and [ʔəɬtih] has shifted from \\\"bow\\\" to \\\"rifle\\\". [hutʼəp].\r\n\r\nLike most of the languages of British Columbia, Carrier is an endangered language. Only about 10% of Dakelh people now speak the Carrier language, hardly any of them children. Members of the generation following that of the last speakers can often understand the language but they do not contribute to its transmission.\r\n\r\nCarrier is taught as a second language in both public and band schools throughout Carrier territory. This instruction provides an acquaintance with the language but has not proven effective in producing functional knowledge of the language. Carrier has also been taught at the University of Northern British Columbia, the College of New Caledonia, and the University of British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe Yinka Dene Language Institute (YDLI) is charged with the maintenance and promotion of Carrier language and culture. Its activities include research, archiving, curriculum development, teacher training, literacy instruction, and production of teaching and reference materials.\r\n\r\nPrior to the founding of YDLI in 1988 the Carrier Linguistic Committee, a group based in Fort Saint James affiliated with the Summer Institute of Linguistics, produced a number of publications in Carrier, literacy materials for several dialects, a 3000-entry dictionary of the Stuart Lake dialect, and various other materials.\r\n\r\nThe Carrier Linguistic Committee is largely responsible for literacy among younger speakers of the language. The Carrier Bible Translation Committee produced a translation of the New Testament that was published in 1995. An adaptation to Blackwater dialect appeared in 2002.\r\n"},{"language_id":6363,"bible_id":"CAFWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Yakʼusda bughunek: k’andit khunek neba lhaidinla","description":null}]},{"id":"CAKEAS","language_id":2912,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2012","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CAKEAS","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Cakchiquel, Eastern 2012 Edition","description":"Kaqchikel (alternatively known as Cakchiquel or Kaqchiquel) is a language of Guatemala.

They consider themselves the descendants of the Olmecs, and are not related to the Oaxacan Chontal.\r\n\r\nThe Yokot'an inhabit 21 towns in a large area known as \\\"la Chontalpa\\\" that extends across five municipalities of Tabasco: Centla, El Centro, Jonuta, Macuspana, and Nacajuca. In Nacajuca, they form a majority of the population. The terrain is highly varied — no single landform dominates — and it has many bodies of water. The land is traversed by seasonally-flooding rivers, and there are numerous lakes, lagoons, and wetlands. The climate is humid and tropical, and the fauna was typical of tropical regions until the environment was altered by human industrialization. The mangrove is the predominant form of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the Yokot'an was the cradle of the Olmec civilization, which lived there from about 1400 BCE until about 400 BCE. The Maya civilization reached its height in about the year 300 of the Common Era. At this time, the Yokot'an were also at their cultural apex. They had already begun to decline by the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán, and are mentioned in the narratives of Bernal Díaz del Castillo and Hernán Cortés.\r\n\r\nIn 1614, the first church was built in Nacajuca, then considered the center of the Yokot'an world. Nacajuca was the only urban center to survive the colonial period, partly due to the introduction of animal husbandry, which limited the range of cultivation.\r\n"},{"language_id":6497,"bible_id":"CHFTBL","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"U Chʼuʼul Tʼan Dios","description":null}]},{"id":"CHYCHB","language_id":1245,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2007","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CHYCHB","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Portions of The Holy Bible in Cheyenne","description":null},{"language_id":1245,"bible_id":"CHYCHB","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Ma'heonemôxe'êstoo'o","description":null}]},{"id":"CHZWBT","language_id":5316,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2003","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CHZWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Ozumacín Chinantec 2003 Edition","description":null},{"language_id":5316,"bible_id":"CHZWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Hmoohˊ hmëëꜘ heˉ\ngaꜙjmeeꜘ Jesucristo","description":null}]},{"id":"CJOWBT","language_id":372,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2008","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CJOWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The New Testament in Ashéninka Pajonal","description":null},{"language_id":372,"bible_id":"CJOWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Iwaperite tajorentsi ikenkithatakoetziri awinkatharite Jesokirishito","description":null}]},{"id":"CJVTBL","language_id":1311,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1992","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CJVTBL","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Chuave 1992 Edition","description":null},{"language_id":1311,"bible_id":"CJVTBL","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Yai Guman Gunom Kam","description":null}]},{"id":"CKDWBT","language_id":2920,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2007","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CKDWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"South Central Cakchiquel New Testament","description":null},{"language_id":2912,"bible_id":"CKDWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Ri C'ac'ac' Ruvujil C'aslen","description":null}]},{"id":"CKEWBT","language_id":2912,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1986","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CKEWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The New Testament in Eastern Cakchiquel","description":null},{"language_id":2912,"bible_id":"CKEWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Ri Dios Nch'o Pa Kach'abül Cheke","description":null}]},{"id":"CKIWBT","language_id":2918,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2013","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CKIWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Santa María Cakchiquel New Testament","description":null},{"language_id":2912,"bible_id":"CKIWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Ri C'ac'ac' Testamento Pa Kach'ab'al","description":null}]},{"id":"CKUPLK","language_id":3186,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1981","scope":"P","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CKUPLK","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"A Portion of the Gospel of Luke","description":null}]},{"id":"CLETBL","language_id":3630,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2008","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"CLETBL","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Lealao Chinantec 2008 Edition","description":"© 2009, Bible League International.

Their ancestral lands are in the forests of Junín, Pasco, Huánuco and part of Ucayali in Peru.\r\n\r\nThe Asháninka are estimated between 25,000 and 45,000. Only a few hundred of these live on the Brazilian side of the border. The Ashaninka communities are scattered throughout the central rainforests of Peru in the Provinces of Junin, Pasco, Huanuco and a part of Ucayali, and the state of Acre.\r\n\r\nThe Asháninka are mostly dependent on subsistence agriculture. They use the slash-and-burn method to clear lands and to plant yucca roots, sweet potato, corn, bananas, rice, coffee, cacao and sugar cane in biodiversity-friendly techniques. They live from hunting and fishing, primarily using bows and arrows or spears, as well as from collecting fruit and vegetables in the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe Asháninka were known by the Incas as Anti or Campa. The Antis, who gave their name to the Inca province of Antisuyu, were notorious for their fierce independence, and their warlike skills in successfully protecting their land and culture against intrusion from outsiders.\r\n\r\nAshanínka tribal societies have faced overwhelming obstacles in disputes over territory and culture against the immigrating Spanish culture and neighboring tribal societies. Biodiversity is the establishment of the Ashanínka way of life, so they treat this biodiversity hotspot as their 'natural capital.' In AD 1542 the European settlers pushed to overtake the natural resources. In June 2010, however, the Brazilian and Peruvian governments signed an energy agreement that allows Brazilian companies to build a series of large dams in the Brazilian, Peruvian, and Bolivian Amazon.\\\" The problem with the 2,000-megawatt Pakitzapango Dam is that it has a permanent location that is proposed to be located in the heart of Peru's Ene valley could displace as many as 10,000 Ashanínka. These encroaching problems have not only extremely changed the generational culture of the Ashanínka tribal societies, but has also changed landscape of what we call modern-day Peru.\r\n© 2008, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.

Other names for the language are Atrato, Chocó, Cholo, Darien, Darien Emberá, Ebera Bedea, Empera, and Panama Embera. There are 72,200 speakers total. The Waunanas and Emberás are the last remnants of a larger group of Pre-Columbian ethnies, such as the Orominas, the Chancos, the Guarras, the Burrumías, that were diminished during the Colonial period. Genetic findings show that the speakers of Chocó languages are genetically differentiated from the Chibcha speaking tribes of Northern Colombia and cluster with the Orinoquian and Amazonian indigenous populations. Waunana and Emberá share a large number of cognates (estimated to 50% by Loewen 1960: 12), which provide evidence for their common origin. However, there is no clear evidence in terms of a sufficient number of cognates for a common origin of Chocó with other South or Central American families. Northern Emberá is a dialect that comes from Embera which is part of the Chocó family. The Chocó family includes two languages, Waunana and the group of the Emberá dialects. The Emberá dialects form a dialectal continuum with two geographically defined subgroups: the Northern branch contains the Proper Northern Emberá (referred to as ‘Northern Emberá’ in Mortensen 1999) and the Katío dialect. The majority of the Katio language are found along the Upper Sinu, San Jorge, San Pedro and Murri Rivers of northwestern Colombia with a few living in Panama. The majority of Darien Embera speakers live in Panama with approximately 2,000 living in northwestern Colombia on the Atrato River."},{"language_id":5008,"bible_id":"EMPWYI","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Ãcõrẽ Bed̶ea","description":null}]},{"id":"ENGT4T","language_id":6414,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2011","scope":"FB","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"CC BY","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"ENGT4T","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"A Translation for Translators","description":"In 1999, the International Conference of Wycliffe Bible Translators (WBT) adopted a proposal called Vision 2025.

The Inupiat language is a member of the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language family and is closely related to Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers of Inupiaq, an official language of the State of Alaska. The name is also rendered as Inupiatun, Inupiaq, Iñupiaq, Inyupiaq, Inyupiat, Inyupeat, Inyupik, and Inupik. The main varieties of the Inupiaq language are Northern Alaskan Inupiaq and Seward Peninsula Inupiaq. The Inupiaq language has been in decline since contact with English in the late 19th century. American colonization and the legacy of boarding schools have created a situation today where a small minority of Inupiat speak the Inupiaq language. There is, however, revitalization work underway today in several communities. © 2010, Wycliffe.

It has also borrowed a large number of words from Dutch in Suriname and other Dutch colonies, and English and French in former British colonies and French colonies. \r\nA large number of words, unique to Caribbean Hindustani, have been created to cater for the new environment that Indo-Caribbeans now live in.\r\nCaribbean Hindustani is the lingua franca of most Indo-Caribbeans, although Tamil and Telugu are the lingua francas for Indians in French Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe; where a majority of the Indians are of Dravidian (South Indian) descent.\r\nLike the Hindustani spoken in the South Asia, Caribbean Hindustani is broken up into Caribbean Hindi and Caribbean Urdu. \r\nHindustani refers to both Hindi and Urdu. Hindi is spoken by Hindus or people of Hindu descent, whereas Urdu is spoken by Muslims and people of Muslim descent. Hindi has more influence from Sanskrit, while Urdu has more influence from Arabic and Persian. \r\nHindi is written in the Devanagari, Devanagari Braille, and Kaithi script, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and Urdu Braille, although in more recent times they both are written in the Latin script and English Braille.\r\n© 2010, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.

Testament in Akateko","description":"Akatek (Acateco) is a Mayan language spoken by the Akatek people primarily in the Huehuetenango Department, Guatemala in and around the municipalities of Concepción Huista, Nentón, San Miguel Acatán, San Rafael La Independencia and San Sebastián Coatán. A number of speakers also live in Chiapas, Mexico. It is a living language with 58,600 speakers in 1998, of which 48,500 lived in Guatemala and the remaining in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAkatek is closely related to the two Mayan languages, Q'anjob'al and Jakaltek. The three languages together form the Q'anjob'al-Jakaltek sub-branch, which together with the Mocho' language form the Q'anjob'alan sub-branch, which again, together with the Chujean languages, Chuj and Tojolab'al, form the branch Q'anjobalan–Chujean.\r\n\r\nAkatek was regarded as a dialect of the Q'anjob'al language until the 1970s, when linguists realized that it has a distinct grammar from that of Q'anjob'al. That it has been thought a dialect of Q'anjob'al is reflected in the many names Akatek has had through time. One of its primary names before it was named Akatek was Western Q'anjob'al, but it has also been called Conob and various names including Q'anjob'al and the municipality where it is spoken.\r\n\r\nOther names for the language are Acatec, Acateco, Conob, Kanjobal, Q’anjob’al, San Miguel Acatán Kanjobal, Western Kanjobal, and Western Q’anjob’al."},{"language_id":7456,"bible_id":"KNJWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Ja' An Nuevo Testamento","description":null}]},{"id":"KOGWBT","language_id":1367,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2014","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"KOGWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The New Testament in Kogi-Cogui","description":null}]},{"id":"KORNES","language_id":3276,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2016","scope":"NTP","script":"Kore","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"KORNES","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"The North Korean / Easy English Study Bible","description":"This Bible is not for sale but rather is given to churches and partner organizations who show an effective plan for their use.

They currently reside in 29 villages in the Araguaia River valley, near lakes and tributaries to the Araguaia and Javaés Rivers, and the Ilha do Bananal. They speak the Karajá language, which is part of the Macro-je language family, which was suggested in 1886 but remained unclassified for the majority of the 20th century until around 1967 (Ribeiro, 2012, p. 268). The language has four dialects: Northern Karajá, Southern Karajá, Javaé, and Xambioá. Within these dialects, males and females speak differently (Ribeiro, 2012; Insituto Socioambiental, 2016). The Karajá language is generally the first language spoken by children, indicating that most speakers are fluent (Museu do Índio, 2016). © 2011, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.

It was this longing for the preservation of culture and life that led the Kayabi to leave their native lands and seek shelter and protection during colonial times when their villages were raided and even destroyed if located on resource rich lands.\r\nThis bible was published in 2012 by Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.

The languages belong to the Popolocan subgroup of the Oto-Manguean language family. Under the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples they are recognized as \\\"national languages\\\" along with the other indigenous languages of Mexico and Spanish. The Mazatec language is vigorous in many of the smaller communities of the Mazatec area, and in many towns it is spoken by almost all inhabitants; however, the language is beginning to lose terrain to Spanish in some of the larger communities like Huautla de Jimenez and Jalapa de Díaz. Like other Oto-Manguean languages, the Mazatecan languages are tonal, and tone plays an integral part in distinguishing both lexical items and grammatical categories. The centrality of tone to the Mazatec language is exploited by the system of whistle speech which is employed in most Mazatec communities and which allows speakers of the language to have entire conversations only by whistling.\r\n © 1960, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc."},{"language_id":2418,"bible_id":"MAUWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Xon⁴-le⁴ ni³na¹ xi³ tʔa³tsʔe⁴ Jesucristo","description":null}]},{"id":"MAWWBT","language_id":4018,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2001","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"MAWWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Mampruli 2001 Edition","description":null}]},{"id":"MBBWBT","language_id":7441,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2013","scope":"OT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"MBBWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Western Bukidnon Manobo Old Testament","description":null},{"language_id":7441,"bible_id":"MBBWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Is Lalag te Megbevayà","description":null}]},{"id":"MBCWBT","language_id":3885,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2013","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"BY-NC-ND","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"MBCWBT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"The New Testament in Macushi","description":"Macushi, also known as Macusi, Macuxi, Makuchi, Makushi, Makusi, Makuxi, Teueia, and Teweya, is a language of Brazil.

Also known as the Mundurucu, Maytapu, and Cara Preta, the Mundurucu's name for themselves is Wuy Jugu. Oral history says the name \\\"Muduruku\\\" comes from their enemies the Parintintin people and means \\\"red ants,\\\" based on the historical Munduruku tactic of attacking en masse. \r\n\r\nThe Munduruku live in southwest of the state of Pará along the Tapajós river and its tributaries in the municipalities of Santarém, Itaituba and Jacareacanga, in the east of the state of Amazonas along the Canumã River in the municipality of Nova Olinda and the municipality of Borba, and in the north of the state of Mato Grosso in the Peixes River region in the municipality of Juara. They usually inhabit forest regions on the margins of navigable rivers, and their traditional villages are in \\\"Tapajós fields\\\", patches of savannah within the Amazon rainforest. The largest numbers live in the Mundurucu Indigenous Territory, with most of the villages along the Cururu River, a tributary of the

It is the homeland of the Chumburu, but Bassari, Gonjas, Kokombas and Nawuri(s) are also indigenous in the area. Land, however, can only be acquired with the permission of the village chief and the king, who are both natives and officials of the Chumburung kingdom. Chumburung is also the name of the language of the Chumburu.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Chumburung encompasses a number of villages at both sides of the Dakar River, from Kojobonipe in the North to Lonto in the South-West and Wiae in the East, both on the shores of Lake Volta. Other towns and villages in the kingdom, roughly from North to South, are Ekumdepe (Kumdi for short), Ba(n)kamba, Chakori, Nanjiro, Tori, Jamboae and Kachanka.\r\n\r\nChumburung is remote from the modern world in many senses. The few roads that exist in the area can only be plied by heavy vehicles, such as lorries, Benz buses in good condition, strong pick-ups and 4WD vehicles. Since few inhabitants can afford such means of transport for private use, the most popular vehicle is the motorcycle. Public transport consists of one Benz daily between Kpandae and Salaga (leaving Kpandae at dawn, arriving in Salaga around 10 a.m., and returning in the afternoon) and one Benz bus daily between Banda and Salaga, serving almost all the villages of Chumburung (leaving Banda at dawn and also returning in the afternoon).\r\n\r\nUp to now (April, 2014), Chumburung is not connected to any electricity network and few inhabitants have their own generators, but Volta River Authority is in the process of connecting some of the towns to its grid. The only telephone company that is active in the area is MTN, but inhabitants of Wiae may get coverage from the Airtel Africa pole in Banda.\r\n\r\nThe first schools in Chumburung were set up by Ashanti teachers in the 1980s; they were later followed by others who started to teach in the local languages including Chumburung.\r\n© 2010, Wycliffe.

The Nomatsigenga ethnic group have a history closely linked to those of Asháninka. It was not until the year of 1635 that missionary activity began in the area on the part of the Franciscans , who founded the Quimiri mission on the banks of the Chanchamayo River. This mission did not last long, because the missionaries were killed.\r\n\r\nThe missions or expeditions that went towards the Ucayali river ran a bad luck, since both the expeditions of the year 1637 and that of 1641 ended with the death of the expeditionaries by the native shipibos of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscan missionaries rebuilt the Quimiri mission in 1673, and continued to advance until the mission of Santa Cruz de Sonomoro was founded, from where the evangelization of the Nomatsigenga peoples of Pangoa, Sonomoro, Miniaro and Anapati began.\r\n\r\nDuring the uprising of Juan Santos Atahualpa (year 1742), the Europeans were expelled from the region.\r\n\r\nAfter the independence of Peru, in 1868 the city of La Merced was founded. It is during this time that the Asháninka resistance breaks down and the colonization of Chanchamayo and the entire central jungle begins. This colonization brought new problems to the Nomatsiguenga social life, which is why there are indigenous uprisings against the abuses committed by the settlers and rubber tappers. It was not until the mid-1950s that the revolts ended.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the 20th century was characterized by violence inflicted by terrorist groups against native communities in the area.

Out of the Paumarí group that inhabits the Tapauá River, the youth, which makes up nearly a majority of the population, spoke only Portuguese in 1964.

The language is also known as Paviotso. There are 700 speakers (Golla 2007). Though, there are 6,000 tribe members (1999 SIL). It is a Western Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Paiute traditionally have lived in the Great Basin in eastern California, western Nevada, and southeast Oregon. The Northern Paiute's pre-contact lifestyle was well adapted to the harsh environment in which they lived. Each tribe or band occupied a specific territory, generally centered on a or wetland that supplied fish and water-fowl. Communal hunt drives, which often involved neighboring bands, would take rabbits and pronghorn from surrounding areas. Individuals and families appear to have moved freely among the bands.\r\n\r\nThey gathered Pinyon nuts in the mountains in the fall as a critical winter food source. Women also gathered grass seeds and roots as important parts of their diet. The name of each band was derived from a characteristic food source. For example, the people at Pyramid Lake were known as the Cui Ui Ticutta (meaning \\\"Cui-ui eaters,\\\" or trout eaters). The people of the Lovelock area were known as the Koop Ticutta, meaning \\\"ground-squirrel eaters;\\\" and the people of the Carson Sink were known as the Toi Ticutta, meaning \\\"tule eaters.\\\" The Kucadikadi of Mono County, California are the \\\"brine fly eaters.\\\"\r\n\r\nRelations among the Northern Paiute bands and their Shoshone neighbors were generally peaceful. There is no sharp distinction between the Northern Paiute and Western Shoshone or Sosone. Relations with the Waasseoo or Washoe people, who were culturally and linguistically very different, were not so peaceful.\r\n\r\nSustained contact between the Northern Paiute and Euro-Americans began in the early 1840s, although the first contact may have occurred as early as the 1820s. Although the Paiute had adopted the use of horses from other Great Plains tribes, their culture was otherwise then largely unaffected by European influences. As Euro-American settlement of the area progressed, competition for scarce resources increased. Several violent confrontations took place, including the Pyramid Lake War of 1860, Owens Valley Indian War 1861-1864, Snake War 1864-1868; and the Bannock War of 1878. These incidents generally began with a disagreement between settlers and the Paiute (singly or in a group) regarding property, retaliation by one group against the other, and finally counter-retaliation by the opposite party, frequently culminating in the armed involvement of the U.S. Army. Fatalities were much higher among the Paiute due to newly introduced Eurasian infectious diseases, such as smallpox, which were endemic among the Europeans. The Natives had no acquired immunity. Sarah Winnemucca's book Life Among the Piutes(1883) gives a first-hand account of this period, although it is not considered to be wholly reliable.\r\n\r\nThe government first established the Malheur Reservation for the Northern Paiute in eastern Oregon. It intended to concentrate the Northern Paiute there, but its strategy did not work. Because of the distance of the reservation from the traditional areas of most of the bands, and because of its poor environmental conditions, many Northern Paiute refused to go there. Those that did, soon left. They clung to their traditional lifestyle as long as possible. When environmental degradation of their lands made that impossible, they sought jobs on white farms, ranches or in cities. They established small Indian colonies, where they were joined by many Shoshone and, in the Reno area, Washoe people.\r\n\r\nLater, the government created larger reservations at Pyramid Lake and Duck Valley, Nevada. By that time the pattern of small de facto reservations near cities or farm districts, often with mixed Northern Paiute and Shoshone populations, had been established. Starting in the early 20th century, the federal government began granting land to these colonies.

Other names for the language are T’boli and Tiboli. \r\n\r\nThe Tboli people are one of the indigenous peoples of South Cotabato in Southern Mindanao. The body of ethnographic and linguistic literature on Mindanao, they are variously known as Tboli, T'boli, Tböli, Tiboli, Tibole, Tagabili, Tagabeli, and Tagabulu. They term themselves Tboli or T'boli. Their whereabouts and identity are somewhat imprecise in the literature; some publications present the Tboli and the Tagabili as distinct peoples; some locate the Tbolis to the vicinity of the Lake Buluan in the Cotabato Basin or in Agusan del Norte. The Tbolis, then, reside on the mountain slopes on either side of the upper Alah Valley and the coastal area of Maitum, Maasim and Kiamba. In former times, the Tbolis also inhabited the upper Alah Valley floor. After World War II, i.e., since the arrival of settlers originating from other parts of the Philippines, they have been gradually pushed onto the mountain slopes. As of now, they are almost expelled from the fertile valley floor.\r\n\r\nLike their immediate tribal neighbors, the Úbûs, Blàan, Blit, Tàú-Segél and, for those who have serious doubts in the hoax argumentation, the Tasaday, they have been variously termed hill tribes, pagans, animists, etc., as opposed to the indigenous Muslim peoples or the Christian settlers. In political contexts, however, the term Lumad groups (derived from the Cebuano term for native people) has become popular as a generic term for the various indigenous peoples of Mindanao.\r\n"},{"language_id":6668,"bible_id":"TBLWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Udél dwata: gna kesfasad ne lomi
