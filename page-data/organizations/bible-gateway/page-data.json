The 1991 revision of the Psalter, the work of thirty revisers and six editors, was further revised by seven revisers and two editors between 2009 and 2010. As suggested in the comments above, the revision aimed at making use of the best manuscript traditions available (see below), translating as accurately as possible, and rendering the result in good contemporary English. In many ways it is a more literal translation than the original NAB and has attempted to be more consistent in rendering Hebrew (or Greek) words and idioms, especially in technical contexts, such as regulations for sacrifices.

Kirkolliskokous k√§sitteli k√§√§nn√∂sty√∂t√§ 1886 ja p√§√§tyi hylk√§√§m√§√§n siihen menness√§ tehdyn ty√∂n ja asetti uuden komitean vanhan tilalle. Uuden komitean johtoon tuli eksegetiikan professori Karl August Reinhold T√∂tterman (1833‚Äì1907). Uusi komitea sai edellist√§ paremmat ohjeet. Alkuper√§isest√§ suunnitelmasta poiketen komitea aloitti Uuden testamentin k√§√§nt√§misest√§ ja keskittyi siihen. N√§in laadittu uusi Uuden testamentin suomennos oli valmis 1912. T√§ss√§ k√§√§nn√∂ksess√§ pohjatekstiksi valikoitui vanhan 1500-luvulta periytyneen tekstin tilalle uusi tieteellinen tekstilaitos, joka paikoin poikkesi vanhemmasta. Komitea ei kuitenkaan ollut asiasta t√§ysin yksimielinen, joten todellisuudessa pohjatesti oli kompromissi n√§iden kahden v√§lilt√§. Vuonna 1913 kirkolliskokous hyv√§ksyi Uuden testamentin, mutta vain v√§liaikaiseen k√§ytt√∂√∂n. Teksti√§ ei pidetty valmiina ja haluttiin n√§hd√§ ensin my√∂s Vanhan testamentin suomennos, ennen kuin virallinen hyv√§ksynt√§ annettaisiin. Samalla raamatunk√§√§nn√∂skomiteaa ohjeistettiin tekstin edelleen ty√∂st√§misess√§. Komitea, jonka j√§senist√∂ ty√∂n kest√§ess√§ vuosikymmeni√§ vaihtui useaan otteeseen, sai Vanhan testamentin valmiiksi 1932. K√§√§nn√∂s hyv√§ksyttiin virallisesti kirkolliskokouksessa 1933. T√§m√§n j√§lkeen komitea laati apokryfikirjojen suomennoksen ja ty√∂sti Uuden testamentin tekstin uudelleen. Uuden testamentin kohdalla komitea siirtyi entist√§ johdonmukaisemmin k√§ytt√§m√§√§n tieteellist√§ Uuden testamentin teksti√§ ja l√§hensi vuoden 1913 kokeilupainoksen kielt√§ alkutekstin ja vanhemman virallisen k√§√§nn√∂ksen sanamuotoihin. Suomennosty√∂ tuli valmiiksi 1936 ja kirkolliskokous hyv√§ksyi sen 1938. Oli kulunut 77 vuotta siit√§, kun p√§√§t√∂s uuden suomennoksen laatimisesta tehtiin."},{"language_id":1928,"bible_id":"FIN38CB","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Vuoden 1938 kirkkoraamattu","description":""}]},{"id":"FRALSG","language_id":6413,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1910","scope":"FB","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"FRALSG","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Louis Segonde Version","description":"Louis Segond, n√© le 3 octobre 1810 √† Gen√®ve (quartier de Plainpalais) et mort le 18 juin 1885 dans cette m√™me ville, est un pasteur et th√©ologien suisse qui, √† la demande de la Compagnie des Pasteurs de Gen√®ve, a traduit la Bible en fran√ßais √† partir des textes originaux h√©breux et grecs.

They took with them their Dutch, West Frisian and Dutch Low Saxon dialects, which over time they mixed with East Low German dialects, the so-called Weichselplatt, of the region. As Mennonites they kept their own (primarily Dutch and Low-German) identity, using Standard Dutch well into the 18th century. At the time of their migration to the Russian Empire, their spoken language resembled the dialects of the region with only some few Dutch elements. Their East Low German dialect is still classified as Low Prussian, or simply Prussian. Russian Mennonites trace their genealogical roots mostly to the Low Countries and north Germany, and to a lesser degree to southern Germany and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the late 18th century, the expanding Russian Empire invited Germans and many from the Kingdom of Prussia, including many Mennonites, to create new colonies north of the Black Sea in an area that Russia had recently acquired in one of the Russo-Turkish Wars. This is now part of Ukraine as well as other countries. Beginning in 1873, many Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites migrated from the Russian Empire to the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Canada started to settle in Mexico, and in 1927 in Paraguay. In the 1930s Mennonites emigrated mainly from Soviet Ukraine directly to Brazil. The first Mennonite settlement in Bolivia was founded in 1957 by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Paraguay. Soon very conservative Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Canada, Mexico, and Belize also relocated to Bolivia, settling together. In 1986/7 a settlement was founded in Argentina by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from other Latin American countries.\r\n"},{"language_id":5561,"bible_id":"PDTPFB","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"De Bibel","description":null}]},{"id":"POLLNT","language_id":5580,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2005","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"POLLNT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Polish Living New Testament","description":"S≈Çowo ≈ªycia, or Word of Life,  is a Protestant paraphrase of the New Testament, was created in the evangelical environment , whose premise is to give the message of Jesus Christ in a modern, intelligible language.
