The 1991 revision of the Psalter, the work of thirty revisers and six editors, was further revised by seven revisers and two editors between 2009 and 2010. As suggested in the comments above, the revision aimed at making use of the best manuscript traditions available (see below), translating as accurately as possible, and rendering the result in good contemporary English. In many ways it is a more literal translation than the original NAB and has attempted to be more consistent in rendering Hebrew (or Greek) words and idioms, especially in technical contexts, such as regulations for sacrifices. In translating the Psalter special effort was made to provide a smooth, rhythmic translation for easy singing or recitation, and to retain the concrete imagery of the Hebrew."}]},{"id":"ENGNCV","language_id":6414,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"1991","scope":"FB","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"©","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"ENGNCV","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"New Century Version","description":"Two basic premises guided the translation process of the New Century Version.

Vuonna 1861 asetettu komitea epäonnistui työssään. Komitealle asetettu aikataulu oli epärealistinen, sen jäsenet keskenään eri mieltä noudatettavasta työtavasta ja työskentelyä varten laaditut ohjeet epämääräisiä. Komitea ei ollut saanut työtään valmiiksi, kun osa sen jäsenistä kuoli 1870-luvulla. 1880-luvulla komitea oli kutistunut kolmijäseniseksi, eikä työ ollut valmis. Kirkolliskokous käsitteli käännöstyötä 1886 ja päätyi hylkäämään siihen mennessä tehdyn työn ja asetti uuden komitean vanhan tilalle. Uuden komitean johtoon tuli eksegetiikan professori Karl August Reinhold Tötterman (1833–1907). Uusi komitea sai edellistä paremmat ohjeet. Alkuperäisestä suunnitelmasta poiketen komitea aloitti Uuden testamentin kääntämisestä ja keskittyi siihen. Näin laadittu uusi Uuden testamentin suomennos oli valmis 1912. Tässä käännöksessä pohjatekstiksi valikoitui vanhan 1500-luvulta periytyneen tekstin tilalle uusi tieteellinen tekstilaitos, joka paikoin poikkesi vanhemmasta. Komitea ei kuitenkaan ollut asiasta täysin yksimielinen, joten todellisuudessa pohjatesti oli kompromissi näiden kahden väliltä. Vuonna 1913 kirkolliskokous hyväksyi Uuden testamentin, mutta vain väliaikaiseen käyttöön. Tekstiä ei pidetty valmiina ja haluttiin nähdä ensin myös Vanhan testamentin suomennos, ennen kuin virallinen hyväksyntä annettaisiin. Samalla raamatunkäännöskomiteaa ohjeistettiin tekstin edelleen työstämisessä. Komitea, jonka jäsenistö työn kestäessä vuosikymmeniä vaihtui useaan otteeseen, sai Vanhan testamentin valmiiksi 1932. Käännös hyväksyttiin virallisesti kirkolliskokouksessa 1933. Tämän jälkeen komitea laati apokryfikirjojen suomennoksen ja työsti Uuden testamentin tekstin uudelleen. Uuden testamentin kohdalla komitea siirtyi entistä johdonmukaisemmin käyttämään tieteellistä Uuden testamentin tekstiä ja lähensi vuoden 1913 kokeilupainoksen kieltä alkutekstin ja vanhemman virallisen käännöksen sanamuotoihin. Suomennostyö tuli valmiiksi 1936 ja kirkolliskokous hyväksyi sen 1938.

They took with them their Dutch, West Frisian and Dutch Low Saxon dialects, which over time they mixed with East Low German dialects, the so-called Weichselplatt, of the region. As Mennonites they kept their own (primarily Dutch and Low-German) identity, using Standard Dutch well into the 18th century. At the time of their migration to the Russian Empire, their spoken language resembled the dialects of the region with only some few Dutch elements. Their East Low German dialect is still classified as Low Prussian, or simply Prussian. Russian Mennonites trace their genealogical roots mostly to the Low Countries and north Germany, and to a lesser degree to southern Germany and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the late 18th century, the expanding Russian Empire invited Germans and many from the Kingdom of Prussia, including many Mennonites, to create new colonies north of the Black Sea in an area that Russia had recently acquired in one of the Russo-Turkish Wars. This is now part of Ukraine as well as other countries. Beginning in 1873, many Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites migrated from the Russian Empire to the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nIn 1922 Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Canada started to settle in Mexico, and in 1927 in Paraguay. In the 1930s Mennonites emigrated mainly from Soviet Ukraine directly to Brazil. The first Mennonite settlement in Bolivia was founded in 1957 by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Paraguay. Soon very conservative Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Canada, Mexico, and Belize also relocated to Bolivia, settling together. In 1986/7 a settlement was founded in Argentina by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from other Latin American countries.\r\n"},{"language_id":5561,"bible_id":"PDTPFB","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"De Bibel","description":null}]},{"id":"POLLNT","language_id":5580,"versification":"protestant","numeral_system_id":"western-arabic","date":"2005","scope":"NT","script":"Latn","derived":"","copyright":"","reviewed":1,"notes":null,"translations":[{"language_id":6414,"bible_id":"POLLNT","vernacular":0,"needs_review":0,"generic":1,"name":"Polish Living New Testament","description":"Słowo Życia, or Word of Life,  is a Protestant paraphrase of the New Testament, was created in the evangelical environment , whose premise is to give the message of Jesus Christ in a modern, intelligible language.

There was no Bible translation but a paraphrase or free interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the New Testament, New Living Bible was that the basic text should be translated so that the language could also be understood by completely unfamiliar Bible readers, and for example, old words such as \\\"righteous\\\", \\\"grace\\\" and \\\"gospel\\\" were revised. The words have been the same in all Swedish translations since the 16th century.
