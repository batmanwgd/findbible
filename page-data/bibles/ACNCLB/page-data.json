The Achang Chinese: 阿昌族; pinyin: Āchāng zú, also known as the Ngac'ang (their own name) or Maingtha (Burmese: မိုင်းသာလူမျိုး) are an ethnic group. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. They also live in Burma.\n\nThe Achang number 27,700, of whom 27,600 are from Yunnan province, especially Dehong Autonomous Prefecture. The Achang speak a Burmish (Burmese-related) language called Achang, but they have no indigenous writing system. Chinese characters are often used instead. Many Achang also speak the Tai Lü language, mainly to make commercial transactions with Dai people. Speaking a distinct dialect, the Husa Achang (戶撒) living in Longchuan County (also in Dehong) consider themselves to be distinct and filed an unsuccessful application in the 1950s as a separate nationality. The Husa were more Sinicized than other Achang. For example, Confucian-styled ancestral memorial tablets are common in Husa homes. Most traditional Husa believe in a mixture of Theravada Buddhism and Taoism."}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"ACNCLB","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/acn-NGCL","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"ACNCLB","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/373/jhn.1.ngcl","title":"FB","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"ACNCLB","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/373","title":"NGCL","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"AE","continent":"AS","name":"United Arab Emirates","laravel_through_key":29}]}}}}
