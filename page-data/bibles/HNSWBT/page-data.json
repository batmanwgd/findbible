It is based on Bhojpuri with influences from Awadhi. \r\nThese were spoken by indentured laborers who came as immigrants to the Caribbean from South Asia. It is closely related to Fiji Hindi and the Hindustani spoken in Mauritius and South Africa.\r\nBecause a majority of people came from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan, Caribbean Hindustani is most influenced by Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj Bhasha, other Bihari dialects, Marwari and other Rajasthani dialects. \r\nIt has a very minor influence from Tamil, Telugu, and other Dravidian languages. It has also borrowed a large number of words from Dutch in Suriname and other Dutch colonies, and English and French in former British colonies and French colonies. \r\nA large number of words, unique to Caribbean Hindustani, have been created to cater for the new environment that Indo-Caribbeans now live in.\r\nCaribbean Hindustani is the lingua franca of most Indo-Caribbeans, although Tamil and Telugu are the lingua francas for Indians in French Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe; where a majority of the Indians are of Dravidian (South Indian) descent.\r\nLike the Hindustani spoken in the South Asia, Caribbean Hindustani is broken up into Caribbean Hindi and Caribbean Urdu. \r\nHindustani refers to both Hindi and Urdu. Hindi is spoken by Hindus or people of Hindu descent, whereas Urdu is spoken by Muslims and people of Muslim descent. Hindi has more influence from Sanskrit, while Urdu has more influence from Arabic and Persian. \r\nHindi is written in the Devanagari, Devanagari Braille, and Kaithi script, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and Urdu Braille, although in more recent times they both are written in the Latin script and English Braille.\r\nÂ© 2010, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.
