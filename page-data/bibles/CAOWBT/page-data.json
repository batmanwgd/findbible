All rights reserved. Chácobo-Pakawara is a Panoan language spoken by about 550 of 860 ethnic tribal Chácobo people of the Beni Department of northwest of Magdalena, Bolivia, and (as of 2004) 17 of 50 Pakawara. Chácobo children are learning the language as a first language, but Pakawara is moribund. Extinct Karipuna may have been a dialect; alternative names are Jaunavô (Jau-Navo) and Éloe. Several extinct and unattested languages were reported to have been related, perhaps dialects. These include Capuibo and Sinabo/Shinabo of the Mamoré River. However, nothing is actually known of these purported languages."},{"language_id":1200,"bible_id":"CAOWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Dios
