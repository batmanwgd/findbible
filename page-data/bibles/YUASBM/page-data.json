There are 735,000 speakers (2000 INALI). 58,800 speakers are monolingual (2007). Other names for the language are Maaya, Maay√°a, Peninsular Maya, and Yucatan Maya. \r\n\r\nYucatec Maya forms part of the Yucatecan branch of the Mayan language family. The Yucatecan branch divides into the subgroups Mopan-itza and Yucatec-Lacandon, which in turn split into four languages: Mopan, Yucatec Maya, and Lacandon. All the languages in the Mayan language family are thought to originate from an ancestral language that was spoken some 5,000 years ago, known as Proto-Mayan."},{"language_id":7795,"bible_id":"YUASBM","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Maya 1992 Edition","description":null}],"filesets":[{"id":"YUASBMN2DA16","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"YUASBM"},{"id":"YUASBM","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"text_format","set_size_code":"C","laravel_through_key":"YUASBM"},{"id":"YUASBM","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"text_plain","set_size_code":"C","laravel_through_key":"YUASBM"},{"id":"YUASBMN2DA","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"YUASBM"}],"links":[{"bible_id":"YUASBM","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/yua-MAYABI","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"YUASBM","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/324/jhn.1.mayabi","title":"FB","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"YUASBM","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/324","title":"MAYABI","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"YUASBM","type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/YUASBM","title":"FB","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9},{"bible_id":"YUASBM","type":"audio_web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/YUASBM","title":"NT","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9}],"country":[{"country_id":"MX","continent":"NA","name":"Mexico","laravel_through_key":7795}]}}}}
