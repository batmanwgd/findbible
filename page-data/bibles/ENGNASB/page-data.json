Work on most books of the Old Testament, begun in 1994 and completed in 2001, was done by forty revisers and a board of eight editors. The 1991 revision of the Psalter, the work of thirty revisers and six editors, was further revised by seven revisers and two editors between 2009 and 2010. As suggested in the comments above, the revision aimed at making use of the best manuscript traditions available (see below), translating as accurately as possible, and rendering the result in good contemporary English. In many ways it is a more literal translation than the original NAB and has attempted to be more consistent in rendering Hebrew (or Greek) words and idioms, especially in technical contexts, such as regulations for sacrifices. In translating the Psalter special effort was made to provide a smooth, rhythmic translation for easy singing or recitation, and to retain the concrete imagery of the Hebrew."}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/eng-NASB","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","type":"web","url":"http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-bible/nasb/genesis/1/","title":"FB","provider":"Biblica","organization_id":4},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/100/jhn.1.nasb","title":"FB","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=49&lang=53","title":"New American Standard Bible","provider":"Bible Gateway","organization_id":417},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/100","title":"nasb","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"IT","continent":"EU","name":"Italy","laravel_through_key":6414}]}}}}
