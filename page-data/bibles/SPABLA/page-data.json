In the absence of an exact, modern translation, many people are turning to paraphrases of God's Word. Recognizing the critical need for a highly accurate, contemporary translation of the Bible, The Lockman Foundation has produced La Biblia de las Américas(The Bible of the Americas).\r\n\r\nThis is a new translation of the Scriptures from the original languages. Completed in 1986 by a team of Latin American evangelical Bible scholars, La Biblia de las Américasis an original work translated from the Hebrew-Aramaic and Greek directly into modern Spanish. La Biblia de las Américas presents the Word of God in a clear and flowing style while strictly adhering to the Hebrew and Greek texts. Following the same principles of translation set for the NASB La Biblia de las Américas is understandable to the general public and also suitable for serious study."},{"language_id":6411,"bible_id":"SPABLA","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"La Biblia de las Américas","description":null}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/La-Biblia-de-las-Am%C3%A9ricas-LBLA/","title":"FB","provider":"BibleGateway","organization_id":417},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"web","url":"http://www.biblestudytools.com/bla/","title":"FB","provider":"Bible Study Tools","organization_id":416},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/89/jhn.1.lbla","title":"FB","provider":"Youversion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/89/jhn.1.lbla","title":"FB","provider":"Buscador","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"print","url":"http://amzn.to/291vLpk","title":"FB","provider":"Amazon Marketplace","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"print","url":"http://www.americanbiblesales.com/search/isbnlist1.php?ISBN=9781586403614&hilite=yes","title":"FB","provider":"American Bible Sales","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"print","url":"http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?isbn=9781586403621&event=AFF&p=1023472","title":"FB","provider":"Christian Book","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"print","url":"http://www.lockman.org/catalog/isbn1cat.php?ISBN=9781586403546&hilite=no&a=30&b=0&title=Biblia+de+Estudio+LBLA","title":"FB","provider":"Lockman Foundation","organization_id":523},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=59&lang=53","title":"La Biblia de las Américas","provider":"Bible Gateway","organization_id":417},{"bible_id":"SPABLA","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/89","title":"lbla","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"IT","continent":"EU","name":"Italy","laravel_through_key":6411}]}}}}
