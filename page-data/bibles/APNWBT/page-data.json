All rights reserved. The Apinajé (also known as Apinalé and Apinajés) are an indigenous people of Brazil. They live in the state of Tocantins, in Eastern Central Brazil.\r\n\r\nIn the late 20th century, immigrants encroached on Apinajé lands, dividing their lands with highways such as the Belém-Brasilia Highway and the Trans-Amazonian Highway. Part of their lands separated by the Trans-Amazonian Highway was taken from them and the tribe is working to regain it.\r\n\r\nApinajé woman farm subsistence gardens, while men fell trees and plant rice. Common crops include bananas, beans, broad beans, papayas, peanuts, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, watermelons, and yams. Apinajé families raise cattle, pigs, and chickens. Hunting and fishing supplement domestic foods. In the past, babaçu nuts were sold for cash.\r\n\r\nApinajé people speak the Apinayé language, a Macro-Jê language. It is spoken in six villages by the majority of the tribe. Some Apinajé people also speak Portuguese.\r\n"},{"language_id":305,"bible_id":"APNWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Tĩrtũm kapẽr ã kagà
