There are 235,000 speakers (2000 INALI). Other names for the language are San Bartolomé Venustiano Carranza Tzotzil, and Tsotsil.\r\n\r\nThe municipalities with largest Tzotzil population are Chamula (48,500), San Cristóbal de las Casas (30,700), and Zinacantan (24,300), in the Mexican state of Chiapas.\r\n\r\nThe Tzotzil language, like Tzeltal and Ch'ol, is descended from the proto-Ch'ol spoken in the late classic period at sites such as Palenque and Yaxchilan. The word tzotzil originally meant \\\"bat people\\\" or \\\"people of the bat\\\" in the Tzotzil language (from tzotz \\\"bat\\\").Today the Tzotzil refer to their language as Bats'i k'op, which means \\\"true word\\\" in the modern language.\r\n"},{"language_id":7049,"bible_id":"TZOSAN","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Achʼ Testamento: Jaʼ scʼoplal ti jaʼ Cajcoltavanejtic li
