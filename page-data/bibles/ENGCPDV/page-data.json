The CPDV is specifically a Roman Catholic translation, which translates both the Old and the New Testaments in the light of Roman Catholic doctrine, in order to make the text more accessible to the Catholic reader. The CPDV carefully avoids inclusive language, instead translating each noun that refers to human persons in accordance with the gender and number of the source text. The word meaning 'sons' is translated as 'sons', the word meaning 'brothers' is translated as 'brothers', and so on. The Vatican norms for Bible translation reject the use of inclusive or gender-neutral language. And yet many modern translations have thoroughly integrated this type of language into the text of the Bible to make it politically-correct."}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"ENGCPDV","type":"web","url":"http://www.acatholic.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Catholic-Public-Domain-Bible.pdf","title":"FBA","provider":"ACatholic.org","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"ENGCPDV","type":"web","url":"http://www.sacredbible.org/catholic/","title":"FBA","provider":"SacredBible.org","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"ENGCPDV","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/42/gen.1.cpdv","title":"FB","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"ENGCPDV","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/42","title":"cpdv","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"IT","continent":"EU","name":"Italy","laravel_through_key":6414}]}}}}
