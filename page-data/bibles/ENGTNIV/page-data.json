Like its predecessor, the NIV, it is explicitly Protestant, which means that the deuterocanonical books are not present. 53 scholars, many of them experts on specific books of the Bible, reviewed the translations teams' work. The translation took more than 10 years to complete and was published by Zondervan and Hodder & Stoughton.
