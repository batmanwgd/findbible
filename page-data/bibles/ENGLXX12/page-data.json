The original English translation was done by Sir Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton and published by Samuel Bagster & Sons, Ltd., in London in 1851. It has entered the Public Domain due to the passage of sufficient time. In the process of scanning and typing the text, the original poetry and prose formatting, as well as peripheral material like introductions and notes, have been omitted.\n\nThis edition of the Septuagint has some language updates. Brenton's word order and punctuation has been mostly retained, meaning that quotation marks are not used, and sentences within quotes may not start with capital letters, as was standard usage in 1851. Names transliterated from Greek to those transliterated from Hebrew in the common English Bibles often differ. These language updates are dedicated to the Public Domain by the author of those edits, Michael Paul Johnson. Therefore this edition may be freely copied, published, etc.\n"}],"filesets":[],"links":[],"country":[{"country_id":"IT","continent":"EU","name":"Italy","laravel_through_key":6414}]}}}}
