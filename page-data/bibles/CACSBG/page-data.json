Chuj is a member of the Q'anjob'alan branch along with the languages of Tojolab'al, Q'anjob'al, Akateko, Popti', and Mocho' which, together with the Ch'olan branch, Chuj forms the Western branch of the Mayan family. The Chujean branch emerged approximately 2,000 years ago. In Guatemala, Chuj speakers mainly reside in the municipalities of San Mateo Ixtatán, San Sebastián Coatán and Nentón in the Huehuetenango Department. Some communities in Barillas and Ixcán also speak Chuj. The two main dialects of Chuj are the San Mateo Ixtatán dialect and the San Sebastián Coatán dialect.\r\nThe Chuj language has been influenced by Spanish, and Chuj speakers have a tendency to borrow Spanish words or code-mix. It is estimated that 70% of the Chuj language is purely Chuj. There are language conservation and revitalization efforts taking place in San Mateo Ixtatán, through groups like the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala. @1999 Bible Society in Guatemala.\r\n"},{"language_id":1314,"bible_id":"CACSBG","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Chuj San Sebastian Bible","description":null}],"filesets":[{"id":"CACSBGN2DA","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"CACSBG"},{"id":"CACSBG","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"text_plain","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"CACSBG"},{"id":"CACSBGN2DA16","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"CACSBG"}],"links":[{"bible_id":"CACSBG","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/cac-CSS","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"CACSBG","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/494/jhn.1.css","title":"FB","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"CACSBG","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/494","title":"CSS","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"CACSBG","type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/CACSBG","title":"NT","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9},{"bible_id":"CACSBG","type":"audio_web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/CACSBG","title":"NT","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9}],"country":[{"country_id":"BO","continent":"SA","name":"Bolivia","laravel_through_key":1314}]}}}}
