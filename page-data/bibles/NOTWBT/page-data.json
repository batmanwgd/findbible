Other names for the language are Atiri and Nomatsiguenga. There are 6,500 speakers (2003 SIL). 5,500 of these speakers are monolinguals. The Nomatsigenga ethnic group have a history closely linked to those of Asháninka. It was not until the year of 1635 that missionary activity began in the area on the part of the Franciscans , who founded the Quimiri mission on the banks of the Chanchamayo River. This mission did not last long, because the missionaries were killed.\r\n\r\nThe missions or expeditions that went towards the Ucayali river ran a bad luck, since both the expeditions of the year 1637 and that of 1641 ended with the death of the expeditionaries by the native shipibos of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscan missionaries rebuilt the Quimiri mission in 1673, and continued to advance until the mission of Santa Cruz de Sonomoro was founded, from where the evangelization of the Nomatsigenga peoples of Pangoa, Sonomoro, Miniaro and Anapati began.\r\n\r\nDuring the uprising of Juan Santos Atahualpa (year 1742), the Europeans were expelled from the region.\r\n\r\nAfter the independence of Peru, in 1868 the city of La Merced was founded. It is during this time that the Asháninka resistance breaks down and the colonization of Chanchamayo and the entire central jungle begins. This colonization brought new problems to the Nomatsiguenga social life, which is why there are indigenous uprisings against the abuses committed by the settlers and rubber tappers. It was not until the mid-1950s that the revolts ended.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the 20th century was characterized by violence inflicted by terrorist groups against native communities in the area. In the 60s there were clashes between the Peruvian army and the MIR , and in the 80s and 90s they suffered the terrorist activity of the MRTA and the Shining Path.\r\n"},{"language_id":4909,"bible_id":"NOTWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Irinibare Tosorintsi Ocomantëgotëri Antigomi
