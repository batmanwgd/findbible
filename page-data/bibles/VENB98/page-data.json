There are Chivenda are Luvenda. There are a total of 3,001,400 speakers. Venda is a region of South Africa.\r\n\r\nVenda was declared self-governing on 1 February 1973, with elections held later in the year. Further elections were held in July 1978. The territory was declared independent by the South African government on 13 September 1979 and its residents lost their South African citizenship. In common with other Bantustans, its independence was not recognized by the international community.\r\n\r\nVenda was initially a series of non-contiguous territories in the Transvaal, with one main part and one main exclave. Its capital, formerly at Sibasa, was moved to Thohoyandou (which included the old Sibasa administrative district) when Venda was declared independent in 1979. Prior to independence it was expanded to form one contiguous territory, with a total land area of 6,807 kmÂ². In the 1984 elections the ruling Venda Independence People's Party (VIPP) lost to the Venda National Party (VNP).\r\n\r\nAt independence in 1979, the population of Vhavenda stood at about 200,000 people. The state was cut off from neighboring Zimbabwe by the Madimbo corridor, patrolled by South African troops, to the North, and from nearby Mozambique by the Kruger National Park.\r\n\r\nThe first President of Venda, Patrick Mphephu, was also a Paramount Chief of the Vhavenda people; he was born and lived in Dzanani in Limpopo. His successor, Orifuna Ndou, was overthrown in a military coup by the Venda Defence Force in 1990, after which the territory was ruled by the Council of National Unity. Venda was re-absorbed into South Africa on 27 April 1994.\r\n"},{"language_id":7214,"bible_id":"VENB98","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Bivhili Khethwa Mafhungo Madifha","description":null}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"VENB98","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/ven-VEN98","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"VENB98","type":"web","url":"http://m.bibles.co.za/index.php/mobile-bibles/tshivenda/tshivenda-1998-4-part/","title":"4 Part Java Bible","provider":"Bibles.co.za","organization_id":123},{"bible_id":"VENB98","type":"web","url":"http://m.bibles.co.za/index.php/mobile-bibles/tshivenda/tshivenda-1998-complete/","title":"Complete Bible Java Bible","provider":"Bibles.co.za","organization_id":123},{"bible_id":"VENB98","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/280/jhn.1.ven98","title":"FB","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"VENB98","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/280","title":"VEN98","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"VENB98","type":"app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sirma.mobile.bible.android&hl=ve","title":"VEN98","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"MA","continent":"AF","name":"Morocco","laravel_through_key":7214}]}}}}
