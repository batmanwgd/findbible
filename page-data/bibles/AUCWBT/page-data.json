Other names for the language are Huaorani, Sabela, Wao Terero, Waodäni, Waodäni Tededö, and Waos. There are 1,650 speakers of Waorani (2004). The ethnic population is 1,800 (2012 SIL). \r\n\r\nThe Huaorani, Waorani or Waodani, also known as the Waos, are native Amerindians from the Amazonian Region of Ecuador (Napo, Orellana and Pastaza Provinces who have marked differences from other ethnic groups from Ecuador. \r\n\r\nThe Huaorani language is a linguistic isolate with no known to be related to any other language.\r\n\r\nTheir ancestral lands are located between the Curaray and Napo rivers, about 50 miles (80 km) south of El Coca. These homelands—approximately 120 miles (190 km) wide and 75 to 100 miles (120 to 160 km) from north to south – are threatened by oil exploration and illegal logging practices. In the past, Huaorani were able to protect their culture and lands from both indigenous enemies and settlers.\r\n\r\nIn the last 40 years, they have shifted from a hunting and gathering society to live mostly in permanent forest settlements. As many as five communities—the Tagaeri, the Huiñatare, the Oñamenane, and two groups of the Taromenane—have rejected all contact with the outside world and continue to move into more isolated areas.\r\n"},{"language_id":7332,"bible_id":"AUCWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Wængonguï nänö
