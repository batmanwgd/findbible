The Inupiat language is a member of the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language family and is closely related to Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers of Inupiaq, an official language of the State of Alaska. The name is also rendered as Inupiatun, Inupiaq, Iñupiaq, Inyupiaq, Inyupiat, Inyupeat, Inyupik, and Inupik. The main varieties of the Inupiaq language are Northern Alaskan Inupiaq and Seward Peninsula Inupiaq. The Inupiaq language has been in decline since contact with English in the late 19th century. American colonization and the legacy of boarding schools have created a situation today where a small minority of Inupiat speak the Inupiaq language. There is, however, revitalization work underway today in several communities. © 2010, Wycliffe.
