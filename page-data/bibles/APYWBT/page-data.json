All rights reserved. In 1993, there were 450 Aparai people. In 2010, there are 398 Apalai people. The tribe calls themselves Aparai. They have been known by Apalai, Appirois, Aparathy, Apareilles, Apalaii, Aparis and Apalaís. The Aparai or Apalai are an indigenous people of Brazil, who live in Amapá and Pará states.[2] A little community is located in French Guiana, in Antecume Pata.[3] They were sedentary slash-and-burn farmers, necessitating periodic relocation as soil became exhausted, but also hunters and gatherers. They spoke a Carib language and in the 20th century their subsistence shifted towards craftwork as they adapted to modern Brazil and the cash economy. Most Aparai people are multi-lingual, and many speak Aparai, Wayana, Portuguese, and Tiriyó, as well as Wajãpi, Aluku, and Criollo. The Aparai language is one of the Karib languages."},{"language_id":301,"bible_id":"APYWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Ritonõpo
