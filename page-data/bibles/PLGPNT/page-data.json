There are 4,000 speakers (2004 FEL). The ethnic population is 4,000 (2004). \r\n\r\nPilagá belongs to the grouping of Guaykuruan (also spelled ‘Waikuruan’ or ‘Guaicuruan’) languages spoken in the Gran Chaco of South America. The word Chaco, of Quichua origin, means ‘territory of hunting’ (Cordeu and Siffredi 1971:5). The Gran Chaco covers an area of about 1 million square kilometers, of which 50% is on Argentinean land, and the other half distributed between Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil (Karlin et alt. 1994). Out of the six languages that have been claimed to belong to this family, only four i.e., Kadiwéu (or Caduveo), Mocoví, Pilagá and Toba are currently spoken. The other two, Abipón and Mbayá, became extinct more than a century ago.\r\n"},{"language_id":5526,"bible_id":"PLGPNT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Nuevo Testamento Pilagá","description":null}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"PLGPNT","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/plg-PLGNT","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"PLGPNT","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/443/jhn.1.plgnt","title":"NT","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"ID","continent":"AS","name":"Indonesia","laravel_through_key":5526}]}}}}
