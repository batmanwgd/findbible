It is also known as Caras-Pretas, Monjoroku, Mundurucu, Paiquize, Pari, and Weidyenye. There is an ethnic population of 10,100 (2002 FUNASA), though 7,500 of them speak  the language (Moore 2006). Also known as the Mundurucu, Maytapu, and Cara Preta, the Mundurucu's name for themselves is Wuy Jugu. Oral history says the name \\\"Muduruku\\\" comes from their enemies the Parintintin people and means \\\"red ants,\\\" based on the historical Munduruku tactic of attacking en masse. \r\n\r\nThe Munduruku live in southwest of the state of Pará along the Tapajós river and its tributaries in the municipalities of Santarém, Itaituba and Jacareacanga, in the east of the state of Amazonas along the Canumã River in the municipality of Nova Olinda and the municipality of Borba, and in the north of the state of Mato Grosso in the Peixes River region in the municipality of Juara. They usually inhabit forest regions on the margins of navigable rivers, and their traditional villages are in \\\"Tapajós fields\\\", patches of savannah within the Amazon rainforest. The largest numbers live in the Mundurucu Indigenous Territory, with most of the villages along the Cururu River, a tributary of the Tapajós.\r\n"},{"language_id":4549,"bible_id":"MYUWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Deus ekawẽntup Kawẽn iisuat
