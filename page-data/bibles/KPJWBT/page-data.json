The Karajá people live in a 180-mile-long area in central Brazil, in the Goiás, Mato Grosso, Pará, and Tocantins provinces. They currently reside in 29 villages in the Araguaia River valley, near lakes and tributaries to the Araguaia and Javaés Rivers, and the Ilha do Bananal. They speak the Karajá language, which is part of the Macro-je language family, which was suggested in 1886 but remained unclassified for the majority of the 20th century until around 1967 (Ribeiro, 2012, p. 268). The language has four dialects: Northern Karajá, Southern Karajá, Javaé, and Xambioá. Within these dialects, males and females speak differently (Ribeiro, 2012; Insituto Socioambiental, 2016). The Karajá language is generally the first language spoken by children, indicating that most speakers are fluent (Museu do Índio, 2016). © 2011, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.
