American missionaries arrived in Port Natal in 1835. Among them were Newton Adams and a number of his colleagues who became the first translators of the Zulu Bible. The first complete Bible was published in New York in 1883. This text is the latest translation of the complete Bible and was published in 1959 with a new orthography published in 1997.
