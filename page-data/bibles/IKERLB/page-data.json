The Moravian Church began working in Labrador in 1771. Among the tasks undertaken by the early missionaries was the translation of portions of the Bible into the native language. It was a slow process, beginning with collections of verses, and then the Gospel of John, followed by Luke. Fifty years later, in 1821, British and Foreign Bible Society published the entire New Testament. From there followed a gradual translation and publication of the books of the Old Testament. In the end there were 7 separate volumes, but never a complete text under one cover. The current publication is a revision of this old translation, published in one volume. In 1980, a meeting of Inuit elders and educators was convened to examine the writing system. A new one was developed – the Labrador Inuit Standardized Writing System – to provide consistency and clarity. It is with this writing system that this new edition of the Bible has been published. This revision was made possible through the dedication and commitment of many people who spent countless hours translating the scripture.
