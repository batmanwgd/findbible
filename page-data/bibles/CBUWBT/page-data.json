All rights reserved. Candoshi-Shapra is an indigenous American language isolate, spoken by several thousand people in western South America along the Chapuli, Huitoyacu, Pastaza, and Morona river valleys. They are also known as Candoshi, Candoxi, Kandoshi, and Murato. There are two dialects, Chapara (or Shapra) and Kandoashi. Candoshi-Shapra is an official language of Peru, like other native languages in the areas in which they are spoken and are the predominant language in use. Around 88.5% of the speakers are bilingual with Spanish. The literacy rate in Candoshi-Shapra is 10-30 % and 15-25% in the second language Spanish. There is a Candoshi-Shapra dictionary; grammar rules have been codified.\r\nCandoshi is unrelated to any living language, or at least not closely. It may be related to the extinct and poorly attested language Chirino. Four words of Chirino are mentioned in Relación de la tierra de Jaén (1586), and they resemble words in modern Candoshi. A somewhat longer list of words is given in the same document for Rabona, across the modern border in Ecuador and include some names of plants that resemble Candoshi, but such words can easily be borrowed.\r\nAmong modern languages, Loukotka (1968), followed by Tovar (1984), connected Candoshi with Taushiro (Pinche). Kaufman (1994) tentatively proposed a Kandoshi–Omurano–Taushiro language family, with Candoshi the most distant of the trio. However, Kaufman (2007) placed Omurano and Taushiro but not Candoshi in Saparo–Yawan.\r\nDavid Payne (1981) proposes that Candoshi is related to Jivaroan, which Payne calls Shuar. Together, Shuar and Candoshi make up a putative Shuar-Candoshi family, for which Payne (1981) provides a tentative reconstruction of Proto-Shuar-Candoshi.\r\n"},{"language_id":1113,"bible_id":"CBUWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Apanlli
