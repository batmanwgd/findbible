The Bribri are an indigenous people of Costa Rica. They live in the Talamanca (canton) in the Limón Province of Costa Rica. They speak the Bribri language and Spanish. There are varying estimates of the population of the tribe. According to a census by the Ministerio de Salud, there are 11,500 Bribri living within service range of the Hone Creek Clinic alone. They are a voting majority in the Puerto Viejo de Talamanca area. Other estimates of tribal population in Costa Rica range much higher, reaching 35,000.\r\nThe Bribri were the autochthonous people of the Talamanca region, living in the mountains and Caribbean coastal areas of Costa Rica and northern Panama. The majority live with running water and a scarce amount of electricity, growing cacao, bananas, and plantain to sell as well as beans, rice, corn, and a variety of produce for their own consumption. \r\nMany Bribri are isolated and have their own language. This has allowed them to maintain their indigenous culture, although it has also resulted in less access to education and health care. Although the group has the lowest income per capita in the country, they are able to raise much of their own produce, medicine, and housing materials, and earn cash to purchase what they can't grow themselves through tourism and by selling cacao, bananas, and plantain.\r\nThe Bribri people live in the mountains and islands southern Costa Rica and northern Panama both on reservations and non-protected areas.\r\nThe Bribri social structure is organized in clans. Each clan is composed of an extended family. The clan system is matrilineal, that is, a child's clan is determined by the clan his or her mother belongs to. This gives women a very important place in Bribri society since they are the only ones that can inherit land. Men's roles are defined by their clan and are often exclusive for men.\r\nCacao has a special significance in Bribri culture, as is the case for most of the indigenous groups in southern Costa Rica and northern Panama. Currently there exists several Bribri women's associations that produce organic, hand made chocolate that helps them in their livelihoods.\r\nThe Shaman, or \\\"awa\\\" holds a very important place in Bribri society. Awapa (plural for awa) train since they are about 8 years old, the training is said to last between 10 and 15 years. Only certain clans are allowed to become awapa. Since the clan comes from the mother's side of the family, an awa cannot teach his own sons, but rather the sons of his female relatives.\r\nAgriculture is the main activity of the Bribri. The Bribri are isolated, and have developed an extensive bartering system. One small group of Bribri, who live in the community called Kekoldi, only has about 200 people. They partake in the unique practice of iguana farming. These iguanas are released into the forest so any other Bribri can hunt them for their food and skin. The farm has been operating for 11 years and has about 2,000 iguanas and 2,000,000 eggs. The iguanas stay on the farm until five years of age at which time they are released into the wild. The Bribri have maintained their own culture."},{"language_id":960,"bible_id":"BZDWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Tte Pa̱'a̱li̱ Me' Skëköl tö Se'
