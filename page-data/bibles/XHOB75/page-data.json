The history of the Xhosa Bible started in 1833 when the first book of the Bible (Luke) was translated in Grahamstown. The first complete Bible followed in 1859 but was published in one volume in 1864. The latest revision of this Bible was done in 1975 and is still widely used. Â© 1975 Bible Society of South Africa.
