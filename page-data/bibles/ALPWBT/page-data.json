They number about 21,300 and live in 27 villages of the western-central area of the island. Like the Wemale, they originated in a common group called Patasiwa.\r\n\r\nThe Alune speak a language of Malayo-Polynesian origin. It is also known as Sapalewa or Patasiwa Alfoeren and, despite the small number of speakers, it has a few dialects. The most prestigious dialect is the Rambatu way of speaking. The Hainuwele legend is an origin myth from the Alune and Wemale folklore. It was recorded by German ethnologist Adolf Ellegard Jensen in a 1937â€“8 expedition to the Maluku Islands.\r\n\r\nLike other ancient human groups living in interior Seram, the Alune traditionally lived off forest products. Their diet is based on the sago palm and they also practiced shifting cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Alune were also skilled carpenters. The ancestral Alune houses were large and elaborate and built of wood, sticks and palm leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Alune culture and lifestyle has changed very much during the last few decades because of the impact of consumerism. Also the political and religious restlessness and the resulting conflict in Indonesia affected many islands of the Maluku area.\r\n"},{"language_id":182,"bible_id":"ALPWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Janji beluke","description":null}],"filesets":[{"id":"ALPWBT","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"text_plain","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"ALPWBT"},{"id":"ALPWBTN2DA","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"ALPWBT"},{"id":"ALPWBTN2DA16","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"ALPWBT"},{"id":"ALPWBT","asset_id":"dbs-web","set_type_code":"text_format","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"ALPWBT"},{"id":"ALPWBTN1DA","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"ALPWBT"},{"id":"ALPWBT","asset_id":"dbs-web","set_type_code":"text_plain","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"ALPWBT"}],"links":[{"bible_id":"ALPWBT","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/alp-ALPNT","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"ALPWBT","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/323/jhn.1.alpnt","title":"NT","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"ALPWBT","type":"web","url":"//dbs.org/bibles/ALPWBT","title":"The Bible Cloud","provider":"Digital Bible Society","organization_id":8},{"bible_id":"ALPWBT","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/323","title":"alpNT","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"ALPWBT","type":"app","url":"https://apk.fcbh.org/Alune_JB","title":"Global Bible App","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9},{"bible_id":"ALPWBT","type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ALPWBT","title":"NT","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9},{"bible_id":"ALPWBT","type":"audio_web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ALPWBT","title":"NT","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9}],"country":[{"country_id":"AO","continent":"AF","name":"Angola","laravel_through_key":182}]}}}}
