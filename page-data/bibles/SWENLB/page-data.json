The earlier edition, the Living Bible, was also a translation from English. The original was written by Kenneth N. Taylor , who would explain the Bible's message for his ten children. There was no Bible translation but a paraphrase or free interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the New Testament, New Living Bible was that the basic text should be translated so that the language could also be understood by completely unfamiliar Bible readers, and for example, old words such as \\\"righteous\\\", \\\"grace\\\" and \\\"gospel\\\" were revised. The words have been the same in all Swedish translations since the 16th century. Understandable messages easily understood by the original recipient are printed in the text or in footnotes.\r\n\r\nThe New Living Bible has been printed in 200,000 copies.\r\n"},{"language_id":6484,"bible_id":"SWENLB","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Nya Levande Bibeln","description":null}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"SWENLB","type":"web","url":"http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-bible/svl/1-mosebok/1/","title":"FB","provider":"Biblica","organization_id":4},{"bible_id":"SWENLB","type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=44&lang=53","title":"Nya Levande Bibeln","provider":"Bible Gateway","organization_id":417},{"bible_id":"SWENLB","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/33","title":"bsv","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"IT","continent":"EU","name":"Italy","laravel_through_key":6484}]}}}}
