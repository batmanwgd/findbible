The area is located in what was named Rupert’s Land under British colonial rule. The people in this area were introduced to Christianity by missionaries. Most associated with the Anglican Church although a few Catholic missions were also active. Like other First Nations associated with protestant missions, the speakers of Moose Cree use the Syllabic script developed by James Evans."},{"language_id":4468,"bible_id":"CRMMCN","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"ᐅᔅᑭ ᑎᔅᑌᒥᓐᑦ","description":null}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"CRMMCN","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/483","title":"MCNT","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"GH","continent":"AF","name":"Ghana","laravel_through_key":4468}]}}}}
