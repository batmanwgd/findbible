Other names for the language are Nibon and Nibong. There are 3,400 speakers of Penan (2007 SIL). The Penan are a nomadic indigenous people living in Sarawak and Brunei, although there is only one small community in Brunei. \r\n\r\nThe Penan number around 16,000; of which only approximately 200 still live a nomadic lifestyle. Penan numbers have increased since they began to settle. The Penan can be broken down into two loosely related geographical groups known as either Eastern Penan or Western Penan; the Eastern Penan reside around the Miri, Baram, Limbang and Tutoh regions and the Western Penan in and around Belaga district.\r\n\r\nThey can be considered as a native group or 'tribe' in their own right, with a language distinct from other neighbouring native groups such as the Kenyah, Kayan, Murut, or Kelabit. However, in government censuses they are more broadly classified as Orang Ulu which translates as \\\"Upriver People\\\" and which contains distinct neighbouring groups such as those above. Even more broadly they are included in the term Dayak, which includes all of Sarawak's indigenous people.  The Penan are noted for their practice of 'molong' which means never taking more than necessary. \r\n\r\nAmong those in Brunei half have been converted to Islam, even if only superficially.  Most Penan were nomadic hunter-gatherers until the post-World War II missionaries settled many of the Penan, mainly in the Ulu-Baram district but also in the Limbang district."},{"language_id":7445,"bible_id":"PNEPNT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Rengah Jian","description":null}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"PNEPNT","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/pne-PNT","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"PNEPNT","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/134","title":"RJ","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531}],"country":[{"country_id":"MM","continent":"AS","name":"Myanmar (Burma)","laravel_through_key":7445}]}}}}
