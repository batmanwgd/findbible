All rights reserved. Cavineña is an indigenous language spoken on the Amazonian plains of northern Bolivia by over 1,000 Cavineño people. Although Cavineña is still spoken, and still learned by some children, it is an endangered language. Guillaume (2004) states that about 1200 people speak the language, out of a population of around 1700. Nearly all Cavineña are bilingual in Spanish.\r\nThe Caviñeno people live in several communities near the Beni River, which flows north from the Andes. The nearest towns are Reyes, to the south, and Riberalta, to the north.\r\n"},{"language_id":1143,"bible_id":"CAVWBT","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Yusuja
