The Society had been preparing literature with Biblical content since 1974 and originally published its Bible with the name \\\\\\\"Lajmi i MirÃ«\\\\\\\" (LIM). The work was translated from the Italian text of the Textus Receptus-based Nuova Diodati Revision 1991 and checked against the original languages and the English King James Version. By 2002 the Society produced a revision of the New Testament which was \\\\\\\"completely revised and compared in detail with the original text.\\\\\\\" This version continues to circulate widely among evangelical churches and is presented in various formats including the \\\\\\\"Bibla e Studimit\\\\\\\" (The New Thompson Study Bible, Albanian version 2009).
