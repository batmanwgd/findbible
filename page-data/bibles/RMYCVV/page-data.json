Vlax Romani varieties are spoken mainly in Southeastern Europe by Romani people. Vlax Romani can also be referred to as an independent language or as one dialect of the Romani language. Vlax Romani is the most widely spoken dialect subgroup of the Romani language worldwide. \r\n\r\nThe language's name is derived from the \\\"Vlachs\\\", a medieval exonym referring to the Romanians, as all the Vlax dialects share an extensive influence from Romanian on vocabulary, phonology and morphology. There have been many waves of migration of Roma out of Romania, some of them being connected to the 19th century abolition of slavery in Romania. This name was coined by British scholar Bernard Gilliat-Smith in his 1915 study on Bulgarian Roma, in which he first divided Roma dialects into Vlax and non-Vlax, based on whether they were influenced by Romanian or not.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the words Romani and Romania is a coincidence, they are not etymologically related.\r\n"},{"language_id":7237,"bible_id":"RMYCVV","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Nuevo Testamento Roman√©","description":null}],"filesets":[{"id":"RMYCVVN2DA16","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"RMYCVV"},{"id":"RMYCVVN2DA","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"audio_drama","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"RMYCVV"},{"id":"RMYCVV","asset_id":"dbp-prod","set_type_code":"text_plain","set_size_code":"NT","laravel_through_key":"RMYCVV"}],"links":[{"bible_id":"RMYCVV","type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/rmy-ROM07","title":"BibleSearch","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":1},{"bible_id":"RMYCVV","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/bible/391/jhn.1.rom07","title":"NT","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"RMYCVV","type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/391","title":"ROM07","provider":"YouVersion","organization_id":531},{"bible_id":"RMYCVV","type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/RMYCVV","title":"NT","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9},{"bible_id":"RMYCVV","type":"audio_web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/RMYCVV","title":"NT","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":9}],"country":[{"country_id":"MC","continent":"EU","name":"Monaco","laravel_through_key":7237}]}}}}
