Like other existing Dutch Bibles, it was merely a translation of other translations. Furthermore, the translation from Martin Luther was widely used, but it had a Lutheran interpretation. At the Synod of Dort in 1618 and 1619, it was therefore deemed necessary to have a new translation accurately based on the original languages. The synod requested the States-General of the Netherlands to commission it.\r\n\r\nIn 1626, the States-General accepted the request from the Synod, and the translation started. It was completed in 1635 and authorized by the States-General in 1637. From then until 1657, a half-million copies were printed. It remained authoritative in Protestant churches well into the 20th century.\r\n\r\nThe source material for the Old Testament was the Masoretic Text. The New Testament was translated from the Textus Receptus.\r\n"},{"language_id":1688,"bible_id":"NLDSTV","vernacular":1,"needs_review":0,"generic":0,"name":"Statenvertaling","description":null}],"filesets":[],"links":[{"bible_id":"NLDSTV","type":"web","url":"http://www.bijbelsdigitaal.nl/view/?bible=sv1637","title":"FB","provider":"Bible Society Netherlands","organization_id":139},{"bible_id":"NLDSTV","type":"web","url":"http://www.statenvertaling.net/","title":"FB","provider":"Statenvertaling.net","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"NLDSTV","type":"web","url":"http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/wb/dut/index.htm","title":"FB","provider":"Sacred Texts","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"NLDSTV","type":"web","url":"https://www.statenvertaling.net/bijbel/gene/1.html","title":"FB","provider":"Bijbel en kunst","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"NLDSTV","type":"web","url":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/svv/genesis/1.html","title":"FB","provider":"Bible Study Tools","organization_id":null},{"bible_id":"NLDSTV","type":"web","url":"https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/bible/dutch-svv/","title":"FB","provider":"New Christian Bible Study","organization_id":null}],"country":[{"country_id":"BW","continent":"AF","name":"Botswana","laravel_through_key":1688}]}}}}
